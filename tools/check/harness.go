// harness.go - what a ported mutation harness needs, in one place.
//
// ⭐ THIS IS scripts/corpus/store-lib.sh AND ITS POWERSHELL TWIN, ported only as
// far as a ported harness calls it. CI-10. Every harness that library serves
// builds an example, makes a scratch directory, plants a literal exactly once,
// counts a row and prints one verdict; the first two harnesses to leave the twin
// layer are `check-cache` and `check-catalogue`, and they call exactly this.
//
// ⛔ A FUNCTION NOTHING CALLS IS A FUNCTION NOBODY KNOWS WORKS. The shell
// library's `place`, `tree_digest` and `tree_files` are deliberately absent, for
// the reason its PowerShell twin gave for leaving them out: they land with the
// first ported harness that exercises them.
//
// -- THE REPORT IS THE CONTRACT -----------------------------------------------
//
// A ported harness answers exactly what its shell half answered: the same
// `{"schema":...,"total":...,"passed":...,"failed":...}` line under `--json`,
// and the same verdict - a run that passed nothing is red whatever else it says.
// `scripts/common/check-bitcheck.sh --compare` holds the two to that, byte for
// byte, before either half is deleted.
