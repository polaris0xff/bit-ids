// bit-check - this repository's checking layer, as one binary on both platforms.
//
// CI-10. The layer this replaces was a `.sh` and a hand-written `.ps1` twin per
// rule, plus `check-twins` to compare them, and the twin was most of the wall
// clock: measured on 2026-09-10 over eleven pairs, the `sh` halves together took
// 7.4 seconds and the PowerShell halves 96, of which `check-control-bytes.ps1`
// alone was 67.9. `check-workflow` runs the whole gate about nine times, so that
// cost is paid nine times on every push.
//
// ⭐ ONE BINARY REMOVES THE CLASS RATHER THAN CHECKING FOR IT. `check-twins`
// exists because two hand-written halves drift. A single implementation that
// runs on both platforms cannot drift from itself, so the comparison stops being
// necessary rather than getting faster.
//
// -- ⛔ WHAT A PORT MAY NOT CHANGE -------------------------------------------
//
// A ported check refuses exactly what its shell half refused, over the same
// planted defect, with the same exit-code vocabulary:
//
//	0  the rule held
//	1  the rule was refused
//	2  the check could not run
//
// ⚠ A port that changed one verdict while getting faster would be trading the
// thing being measured for the measurement. `scripts/common/check-bitcheck.sh`
// is what compares each ported check against the halves it replaces, case for
// case over the same plants, and it runs BEFORE any half is deleted.
//
// -- ⭐ NO DEPENDENCIES, WHICH IS A SUPPLY-CHAIN PROPERTY AND NOT A PREFERENCE -
//
// This module has an empty require list and therefore no `go.sum`. Nothing here
// is fetched at build time, so a build needs no network and no pin audit, and
// `CI-04`'s dependency surface does not grow by a language.
//
// Usage:
//
//	bit-check <check> [--json]
//	bit-check check-licences --permitted
//	bit-check check-no-secrets --public
//	bit-check check-remote-items [--repo OWNER/NAME]
//	bit-check --rows
//
// ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped. ⚠ `go run . <check>` is a
// different process: it exits 1 for any non-zero exit of the program it ran, so
// a refusal and a could-not-run are one code through it. Measured 2026-09-29.
