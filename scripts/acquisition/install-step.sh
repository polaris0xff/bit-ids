# install-step.sh - what *Install the client* does, in a file, so the step's own
# process can be bounded from outside it.
#
# ⛔ EVERY BOUND TRIED SO FAR HAS FAILED, AND EACH FOR ITS OWN REASON. `timeout`
# inside `install-client` ends its own child, so it cannot end a shell blocked in
# a command substitution around that child. `timeout-minutes` is the runner's and
# was measured on run 6 not to end the step at all. A watchdog loop in the step's
# own shell was measured on run 9 not to fire either - the deadline passed by
# three minutes - which says the step's shell is not the thing running.
#
# ⭐ SO THE BOUND MOVES OUTSIDE THE SHELL ENTIRELY. The workflow runs this file
# under `timeout`, so the step's own process is the one being ended, and nothing
# inside it has to be reachable for that to work.
#
# ⚠ THE POINT IS NOT THE INSTALL. It is that the step ENDS: a job whose runner is
# killed leaves no log and no artifact - measured on runs 7, 8 and 9 - so an
# aria2 lane that hangs teaches nothing at all unless something makes the job
# reach its uploads.
#
# ⛔ AND NOTHING IT SPAWNS INHERITS THE STEP'S OUTPUT. A runner ends a step when
# the command has exited AND the step's output pipe has reached end of file, so
# the route's output goes to a file and is printed afterwards.
#
# Usage:
#   ADAPTER=<path> ROUTE=<name> RUNNER_TEMP=<dir> sh scripts/acquisition/install-step.sh
#
# Exit codes: 0 installed, 1 the route or a guard refused, 2 could not run,
# 124 from a `timeout` that fired. ⚠ TWO DIFFERENT ONES NOW PRODUCE 124, and the
# watchdog log separates them: this file's own PRIVILEGED bound around the
# install, which ends the root tree and lets this file print what it has; and the
# caller's bound around this file, which means even that did not answer.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# ⛔ THE INSTALL RUNS IN THE BACKGROUND SO THIS SHELL CAN RECORD WHAT THE HOST IS
# DOING WHILE IT RUNS. ⚠ That loop is NOT the bound any more - run 9 measured it
# not firing - it is the evidence: `stat` beside `etimes` is what separates a
# command that is slow from one that is stopped, and eight runs of step timings
# could not tell those apart.
# ⛔ THE REDIRECTION IS THIS SHELL'S, WHICH IS THE POINT RATHER THAN AN
# OVERSIGHT: the descriptor the install inherits must be that FILE and not this
# step's output pipe. A runner ends a step when the command has exited AND the
# step's pipe has reached end of file, so anything the route leaves behind
# holding that pipe keeps the step open whatever any bound does.
#
# -- ⛔ AND THERE IS NO `sudo` HERE ANY MORE. `ACQ-06`. -----------------------
#
# Every bound this entry measured failing was issued by an UNPRIVILEGED process
# at a process tree running as ROOT, and the kernel refuses that signal:
# measured on 2026-09-16, a uid-1001 `timeout -k 2 5` around `sudo -E sh -c
# 'sleep 120'` exited 124 on schedule and left the root `sleep` alive with PPID 1
# - orphaned, unkillable by its own bound, and still running after the KILL grace
# had passed. The repair then was to put the bound INSIDE the `sudo`.
#
# ⭐ THE PRIVILEGE IS GONE INSTEAD, WHICH REMOVES THE ASYMMETRY RATHER THAN
# WORKING AROUND IT. The install writes into a prefix this user already owns -
# `install-rootless.sh --prefix` is the one derivation - so every process in this
# subtree runs as the same uid as this shell, and a bound issued here can reach
# every one of them. ⚠ That is not another bound: it is the condition under which
# the bounds that are already here can work at all.
#
# ⚠ THE RELATION IS WHAT MATTERS, not the number. This must be LARGER than
# `install-client`'s own inner bounds, so a slow route is refused by that script
# with a message naming its timeout rather than killed here with nothing to read;
# and SMALLER than the workflow step's own `timeout`, so this one is reached
# first. The workflow states both.

# eleventh would fail the same way, because a step ends when its command has
# exited AND its pipe has reached end of file, and a bound only ever acts on the
# first.
# ⭐ So this shell stops waiting on its own schedule. The install may still be
# running when it does, and that is deliberate: the runner is destroyed after the
# job, and a finished step with a timeline in the artifact is worth more than a
# tidy host nobody can read.

#
# ⛔ AND IT NO LONGER RUNS UNDER `sudo`, BECAUSE THE INSTALL NO LONGER DOES.
# The reason it was privileged is that an unprivileged reader of `/proc` reports
# nobody holding a file that ROOT processes are holding - which was a true fact
# about a privileged install. ⭐ Every process this step starts now runs as this
# uid, so this reader sees all of them, and the report stops depending on a
# privilege the step exists to do without. ⚠ A holder belonging to some OTHER
# user is outside what it can see, and that is a narrower claim than before
# rather than the same one: `TODO/acquisition.md` carries it under `ACQ-06`.
#
# ⛔ AND THIS SHELL'S OWN STDOUT IS ASKED ABOUT TOO, WHICH IT NEVER WAS. The
# report was pointed at `step.log` alone, so `holders.log` answered `0 holder(s)`
# on every green run - truthfully, and about the wrong descriptor. The file that
# keeps a STEP open is the step's own output, and nothing had ever asked who held
# it. ⚠ `readlink` is resolved HERE rather than inside the reporter, because
# `/proc/self/fd/1` there would name the reporter's own stdout. ⚠ When it names a
# pipe rather than a file the reporter says so, which is itself the answer: it
# means this shell is still talking down a pipe somebody may be holding.
# ⛔ fd 1 IS DUPLICATED FIRST, BECAUSE INSIDE `$( )` fd 1 IS THE SUBSTITUTION'S
# OWN PIPE. Reading `/proc/self/fd/1` there names that pipe and never this
# shell's real output - measured on 2026-09-16, when this line reported a pipe
# over a step whose stdout was a file. ⚠ It is the same confusion between a pipe
# and a destination that this whole entry is about, reproduced in the diagnostic
