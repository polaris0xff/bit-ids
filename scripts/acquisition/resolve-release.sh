#!/bin/sh
# resolve-release.sh - decide which artifact the `release` route will fetch, on
# a host that still has a route off itself.
#
# ⛔ THIS IS WHY EVERY `release` ROUTE IN THIS TREE HAS BEEN UNRUNNABLE. Each of
# the three adapters refuses without `BIT_IDS_RELEASE_URL` "resolved before the
# route was cut", and nothing in the repository resolved one: `resolve-stable`
# orders versions and does not choose an artifact, so `capture-client.yml` passed
# `--route package` and only that. This is the missing half.
#
# ⛔ AND IT RUNS BEFORE THE ROUTE IS CUT, FOR THE SAME REASON THE INSTALL DOES.
# It reads a vendor's release listing over the network; a host with no default
# route cannot, and restoring egress to find out which file to download would be
# undoing the containment on the machine that exists to have it.
#
# -- ⭐ WHERE EACH DECISION LIVES ---------------------------------------------
#
# The adapter says WHICH repository, HOW that target spells versions and WHICH
# artifact of a release is the installable one, because it is already the only
# file in this repository that knows how a particular product is installed. It
# says so through `describe`, which is a pure read the callers already parse for
# `binary=`; a sixth subcommand would be a second door into the same answer.
#
# `fetch-releases.sh` retrieves and keeps the exact bytes. `resolve-stable`
# orders the versions. `select-asset` picks the artifact. Shell orchestrates and
# Rust parses, which is the line docs/architecture.md section 3 draws.
#
# ⚠ ONE RESPONSE ANSWERS BOTH QUESTIONS. The version and the asset come out of
# the same body, so the digest this record carries covers both decisions and
# nothing is fetched twice.
#
# ⚠ `--listing` MAKES THE SOURCE A FILE, the way `assert-disposable --route-table`
# makes the routing table one, and for the same reason: a rule that can only be
# exercised by reaching a vendor is a rule the gate cannot run. ⛔ It PRINTS that
# it read a file, so a run over a recorded response is visible in a log rather
# than indistinguishable from one that asked the vendor.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/acquisition/resolve-release.sh --adapter <path> --workdir <dir>
#                                             [--record <file>] [--listing <file>]
#
# Prints the artifact URL on stdout. Exit codes: 0 resolved, 1 the resolver or
# the selection refused, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
