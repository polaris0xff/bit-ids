# check-rootless.sh - `ACQ-06`'s acceptance: every release route installs with no
# privilege, into a prefix the current user owns, and behaves identically on a
# host where `sudo` does not exist at all.
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS EXISTS TO REFUSE. Every install this project performed needed
# `sudo` and wrote to `/usr/local/bin`, so what it did depended on a host this
# project does not control - and that was the one variable between an install
# that exits 0 in a second here and a step no bound could end on a runner.
# `TODO/acquisition.md` carries the entry.
#
# -- ⛔ THE VENDOR IS A FILE, AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THIS CAN BE A GATE ROW ---
#
# A harness that fetched four real artifacts would make the gate depend on four
# vendors being up, and a red row for somebody else's outage is a row people
# learn to re-run rather than read. So each route is handed a `file://` URL, the
# way `resolve-release --listing` is handed a recorded response - and `curl`
# fetches it through the same call, with the same bounds, as a real one.
#
# ⚠ WHAT THAT DOES NOT ESTABLISH is what a vendor publishes today. It
# establishes what the ROUTE does with bytes, which is this entry's subject.
#
# -- ⚠ AND WHICH USER IT DROVE IS PRINTED, NEVER ASSUMED ----------------------
#
# ⛔ A SESSION HOST IS `root` AND A RUNNER IS NOT, and that difference hid two
# real defects for eight dispatches. A root run of a rootless install exercises
# the same code - nothing writes outside the prefix any more - but it cannot
# establish that an unprivileged user could have done it.
#
# ⭐ So `BIT_IDS_ROOTLESS_USER` names an existing unprivileged account to drive
# as, and the report says which user answered. On a runner the gate already runs
# as uid 1001 and the variable is unnecessary; on a session host it is how the
# driven pass is taken. ⛔ This file creates no account: a gate row that ran
# `useradd` would be mutating the host it is checking.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/acquisition/check-rootless.sh [--json]
#   BIT_IDS_ROOTLESS_USER=runnerlike sh scripts/acquisition/check-rootless.sh
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case passed, 1 a case failed, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
