#!/bin/sh
# resolve-source.sh - decide which tag the `source` route will build, from the
# repository's own refs rather than from its release listing.
#
# ⛔ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE TWO LANES OF ONE DISPATCH WERE ONE ROUTE. Measured on
# 2026-09-09 by assembling `capture-client` run 14: both its lanes read the same
# release listing - their `resolution.txt` differ only in their timestamps, with
# one `source_url`, one `listing_sha256` and one `asset_url` - and `E-ACQ-07`
# calls two routes sharing a resolver one route. `capture-client.yml` did that
# deliberately, so that both lanes could not land on different versions.
#
# ⭐ ABSOLUTE 4 ALREADY ANSWERS THAT WORRY, AND ANSWERS IT BETTER. Version
# equality is checked AFTER installation, on what each build reported when asked
# - never trusted from a filename, a tag or a package index. So two independent
# resolutions that landed on two versions is a vendor that moved between two
# reads, and catching it is the correct outcome. Forcing one resolution
# manufactures the agreement instead of measuring it, which is exactly what
# `E-ACQ-07` exists to refuse.
#
# -- ⭐ WHAT MAKES THIS A DIFFERENT SOURCE ------------------------------------
#
# `git ls-remote --tags --refs` asks the repository what tags it has. A releases
# listing asks an API what release OBJECTS were published, which is a different
# and much smaller population: measured on 2026-09-05, `qbittorrent`'s releases
# endpoint answered with four entries while its tags endpoint answered with at
# least a hundred. Two indexes that can disagree about the newest version are
# two resolvers, which is what `E-ACQ-07` compares.
#
# ⛔ THE ORDERING IS THE SAME AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. `VersionScheme::components`
# is this project's ONE version ordering and every caller uses it; a second
# implementation here would be a second answer to which version is newest.
# `E-ACQ-07` compares what DECIDED - the index - not the arithmetic.
#
# ⚠ WHAT A REFS SOURCE CANNOT DO IS FLAG A PRERELEASE. A releases listing
# carries `prerelease` and `draft`; refs carry a name. What survives is the
# version text, and `resolution.rs` records the limit beside the reader.
#
# ⚠ `--refs <file>` MAKES THE SOURCE A FILE, the way `resolve-release --listing`
# does, and for the same reason: a rule that can only be exercised by reaching a
# vendor is a rule the gate cannot run. ⛔ It PRINTS that it read a file.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/acquisition/resolve-source.sh --adapter <path> --workdir <dir>
#                                            [--record <file>] [--refs <file>]
#
# Prints the selected tag on stdout. Exit codes: 0 resolved, 1 the resolver
# refused, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
