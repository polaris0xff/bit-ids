# check-release-route.sh - does every shipped adapter's release route resolve to
# exactly one artifact, and does the resolver refuse every way it can be wrong?
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR IS THE AMBIGUOUS MATCH, and it is not hypothetical.
# qBittorrent's release-5.2.3 publishes TWO Linux AppImages differing only by an
# `_lt20` between the version and the architecture, so a pattern written
# `qbittorrent-*_x86_64.AppImage` matches both. A selector that took the first
# would install whichever the vendor happened to list first, and the record would
# look identical the month that order changed.
#
# -- ⭐ IT RUNS OVER RECORDED RESPONSES AND SAYS SO ---------------------------
#
# `resolve-release --listing` makes the source a file, the way
# `assert-disposable --route-table` makes the routing table one. A rule that can
# only be exercised by reaching three vendors is a rule the gate cannot run, and
# a gate that reached three vendors would go red when one of them was down.
#
# ⚠ SO THIS PROVES THE PATTERN AGAINST A RELEASE THAT PROVABLY DID NOT MOVE, and
# nothing about what those vendors publish today. `listings/README.md` says how
# the recorded responses were made and what re-making them costs.
#
# ⛔ NOTHING HERE PLANTS IN A TRACKED FILE. Every adapter a case mutates is a
# copy in scratch state, because a gate check that edits a tracked file leaves a
# dirty tree behind when it is interrupted.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/acquisition/check-release-route.sh
