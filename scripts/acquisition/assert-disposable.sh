# assert-disposable.sh - refuse to install or run a client on a host somebody keeps.
#
# ⛔ THIS RUNS BEFORE THE INSTALL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The run manifest
# already refuses to RECORD a capture whose host was not disposable, per
# `E-MAN-30`. That guard cannot stop one: by the time a manifest exists, an
# untrusted installer has already run somewhere. A record-layer refusal is a
# report, not a boundary.
#
# -- ⭐ TWO INDEPENDENT GUARDS, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT ONE ---------------------
#
#   --claim    the host has never been used for a capture before
#   --egress   the host cannot reach anything but loopback
#
# They fail for different reasons and neither implies the other. A fresh host
# with an open route leaks the capture onto the public network. A firewalled
# host that already ran a capture contaminates this one with the last one's
# state. `docs/AGENTS.md` section 5 requires both to exist before any client is
# installed.
#
# -- ⛔ --claim DETECTS THE FAILURE RATHER THAN TRUSTING THE CLAIM ------------
#
# The obvious design is a token the provisioner writes saying "this host is
# disposable". ⚠ That is a promise, and a promise is exactly what fails
# silently: a runner misconfigured to persist its disk still carries the token,
# still says disposable, and nothing notices until two captures share state.
#
# So this claims the host by WRITING a marker, and refuses if one is already
# there. A second capture on one host means the host survived the first, which
# means it was never disposable, whatever anything claimed. The evidence is the
# marker's existence and it cannot be faked by getting the configuration wrong.
#
# ⚠ The marker therefore lives where a real teardown destroys it and a survived
# host keeps it. `/var/lib` is deliberate: `/run` and `/tmp` are cleared by a
# reboot, so a host that rebooted rather than being destroyed would read as
# fresh. Override with BIT_IDS_STATE_DIR only to test this script.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.sh --claim <run-id>
#   sh scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.sh --egress [routing-table]
#   sh scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.sh --fingerprint
#
# --claim prints the host fingerprint it recorded. --fingerprint prints the
# current one without claiming, so the next job can compare and see a different
# host.
#
# ⚠ BOTH GUARDS PRINT THE INPUT THEY READ, and that is not decoration. The
# routing table is an optional argument and the marker directory an environment
# variable, so that the runner test can drive them against fixtures. A seam a
# test can use is a seam a misconfiguration can use, so a passing run says which
# table and which marker it trusted, and an evidence bundle carries the answer.
# A guard that passed over a fixture is then visible rather than indistinguishable
# from one that passed over the machine.
#
# Exit codes: 0 the guard passed, 1 the guard refuses, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# ⛔ Reports whether anything but loopback is reachable, WITHOUT sending a
# packet anywhere. The kernel's own routing table says what the host would do;
# it opens no connection and touches no third party. Probing a real host to see
# whether egress works would be reaching out from a machine this guard exists to
# establish is contained, which is exactly the wrong order.
#
# ⚠ Read from /proc/net/route rather than from ip(8). A capture host is a
# minimal image and `ip` is not on all of them, and a guard that answers "could
# not establish" on the hosts it most needs to check is a guard that does not
# run where it matters. The kernel interface needs no package.
#
# A default route is destination 00000000 with the UP flag (0x1) set.
#
# ⛔ POSIX awk only. The first version tested the flag with `and(strtonum(...))`,
# which are gawk extensions: on this session's host, with a POSIX awk, they are
# undefined functions, awk exits non-zero, and the guard reported "could not
# establish" over a machine that plainly had a default route. It failed closed,
# which is the right direction, but a guard that cannot run on a minimal image
# is a guard that does not run where it matters most. The UP bit is the low bit
# of the flags word, so the last hex digit being odd is the same test with no
# extensions.
