# check-gate.ps1 - run the whole local gate, in one command, and read every
# exit code from the process that produced it.
#
# ⭐ THE TWIN OF check-gate.sh, and the only one that runs at all on a native
# PowerShell session with no POSIX layer. It runs the .ps1 half of every pair,
# which is the half that host can actually execute.
#
# ⚠ IT IS NOT IN check-twins.sh's PAIR LIST, and that is deliberate rather than
# an omission. This runner INVOKES check-twins, so comparing the two runners
# from inside check-twins would recurse. scripts/README.md carries the same
# reasoning for why check-twins itself has no twin.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a gate that is a LIST. A list run by hand
# is run in the order somebody recalls it. ⛔ The session that first wrote the
# sh half ran its gate five times and typed a different subset each time.
#
# ⭐ IT DELEGATES. It holds no rules of its own. Every verdict is some other
# script's, read unpiped.
#
# -- ⛔ A SKIPPED CHECK IS A SKIP, NEVER A PASS -----------------------------
#
# A runner that quietly dropped a check and printed green would be the row in
# docs/conventions/forbidden-patterns.md that reads *a step that exits 0 having
# done nothing it was asked to do*. A skip is counted, named, and printed on
# its own line. ⭐ -Strict makes a skip a failure, which is what a CI job should
# pass, since there the tools are installed on purpose and a skip means the
# install broke.
#
# -- ⛔ AND A CHECK THIS HOST CANNOT RUN IS NOT A CHECK THAT BROKE ------------
#
# ⛔ THIS LANE IS WHERE THAT DISTINCTION WAS MISSING AND IT COST THE FLAG.
# Six rows below are checks Windows genuinely cannot run, so -Strict would have
# refused every correct tree and the workflow ran without it. Measured on
# 2026-09-06: with check-project.ps1 rewritten to exit 2, this runner's own CI
# invocation still exited 0. A check that stopped running was indistinguishable
# from one that never could.
#
# ⭐ So a row is one of two kinds. A DECLARED unavailability is written here,
# with a reason and the entry that owns it, and prints as `n/a`. An OBSERVED
# skip is a check that ran and answered 2, or one whose file is gone, and
# prints as `SKIP`. -Strict refuses the second and permits the first.
#
# ⚠ -Fast counts as declared, because the caller asked for it rather than the
# host failing to supply it.
#
# ⛔ AND ZERO PASSES IS RED WHATEVER THE SKIPS SAY. The sh half produced
# exactly that on its first run, through a broken presence test: nine skips,
# zero failures, and a green verdict over nothing at all.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1 -Fast
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1 -Strict
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1 -Json
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/common/check-gate.ps1 -Rows
#
# ⭐ -Rows PRINTS THE ROW NAMES AND RUNS NOTHING. Nothing compared the two
# runners' row lists: this half declares each row by hand and the sh half derives
# most of its provers from a list, so one added to that list and forgotten here is
# simply absent from this lane, which stays green because it never hears of it.
# check-gate-rows.sh is what compares them, and it needs no gate run at all.

# ⛔ AND THIS ONE'S REASON IS AN ENTRY IN FLIGHT RATHER THAN A PLATFORM FACT.
# check-bitcheck plants defects against the Go binary that CI-10 is porting the
# checking layer into. ⭐ That binary runs natively on this platform - it is the
# whole point of the port - so the gap is the HARNESS, which is still `sh`.

# exists to delete.
Add-Unavailable 'check-bitcheck' 'an sh harness over a Go binary that does run here; closes when CI-10 moves the harness into Go'

# ⛔ AND THIS ONE'S REASON IS THE MOST SPECIFIC ON THE LANE, because a
# PowerShell half of it would not be the same check. check-step-bodies runs a
# workflow step's body through a POSIX PIPE and asks whether that pipe reached
# end of file once the body exited - which is how a runner decides a step is
# over. ⚠ A Windows half would need the same instrument over a named pipe and
# would be measuring a different operating system's answer to the same question,
# rather than the second implementation of one rule that check-twins compares.
# ⭐ It runs the `pwsh` half of its SUBJECT anyway: three of its cases execute
# capture.yml's Windows *Restore the route* block under GitHub's own wrapper
# form, which is why this row is declared and not a gap in what is proved.
Add-Unavailable 'check-step-bodies' 'it lifts a Linux-only workflow bodies and already runs the pwsh ones; CI-07 class D'

# ⛔ ITS SUBJECT IS EVERY `.sh` IN THE TREE, and the tools that read them are

# fact - it is that the equivalent question for THIS lane is a PowerShell linter
# over the `.ps1` files, which is a different tool and its own work. ⚠ Declared
# with its own reason rather than a neighbour's: a row whose reason names the
# wrong event closes on the wrong day.
Add-Unavailable 'check-shell' 'its subject is the sh scripts; a ps1 linter is its own work; CI-08'

# ⚠ AND THIS ONE IS DECLARED WHILE ITS SUBJECT IS EXERCISED ANYWAY, which is the
# third kind of reason on this lane. check-capture is an sh harness, so it cannot
# run here; what it drives includes capture-run.ps1, which the Windows job of the
# capture workflow runs on a real Windows host with no route table argument. That
# is a stronger control than this lane could give and it happens elsewhere.
Add-Unavailable 'check-capture' 'its subject PowerShell half exists and the capture workflow runs it; CI-07 class D'

# ⛔ ITS REASON IS NOT check-capture's, AND COPYING THAT ONE WOULD RECORD A GAP
# THAT CLOSES ON THE WRONG EVENT. check-capture is declared because its SUBJECT
# has a PowerShell half that runs somewhere else. capture-client.sh has no
# PowerShell half at all, and capture-client.yml is a Linux-only workflow, so
# nothing on any lane exercises a Windows client capture. ⚠ That closes when
# CI-07 writes the twin, not when a capture is dispatched.
Add-Unavailable 'check-capture-client' 'an sh harness whose subject has no PowerShell half yet; CI-07'

# ⛔ AND ITS REASON IS A THIRD ONE AGAIN. check-release-route drives
# resolve-release.sh, which is `sh`, over recorded listings; the decision it
# proves is in Rust and the Rust suite exercises it on both lanes. What this lane
# does not exercise is the shell that composes the three steps. ⚠ It closes when
# CI-07 writes that twin, and a Windows adapter is what would need one.
Add-Unavailable 'check-release-route' 'an sh harness whose subject has no PowerShell half yet; CI-07'

# ⛔ AND A FOURTH REASON. check-assemble's subject is a Rust example, which both
# lanes build and neither lane runs anywhere else; what has no PowerShell half is
# the harness that writes the synthetic lanes and plants in them. ⚠ It is
# `store-lib.sh`'s again - the shared library CI-07 names as its first step -
# rather than anything about the assembler, which is platform-independent.
Add-Unavailable 'check-assemble' 'a portable Rust subject; it needs store-lib.ps1; CI-07 class A'

# subject is `python3` and a file of stdlib Python: it runs here exactly as it
# runs on the Linux lane, and a Windows runner carries a Python too. So this is
# class A rather than class C - what has no PowerShell half is the harness that
