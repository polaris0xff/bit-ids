# check-gate-rows.sh - do the two gate runners run the same set of rows?
#
# ⛔ NOTHING COMPARED THEM, and the gap is structural rather than accidental. The
# `sh` runner derives most of its provers from a `for` list; the PowerShell
# runner declares each one by hand as a run or an `Add-Unavailable`. A prover
# added to the first and forgotten in the second is simply ABSENT from the
# Windows lane, which stays green because it never hears of it - and `--strict`
# cannot help, because a row that was never named cannot be counted as a skip.
#
# ⚠ IT BIT IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE GAP WAS FOUND. `check-capture-client` went into
# the `sh` list and the Windows lane would have run one row fewer, with nothing
# anywhere naming the one that was missing. `CI-07` carries the entry.
#
# -- ⛔ WHY THIS IS NOT check-twins' JOB -------------------------------------
#
# `check-twins.sh` deliberately does not pair the gate runners: a harness that
# ran both gates, running inside the gate, would re-enter itself. ⭐ `--rows`
# and `-Rows` run NO check at all - each prints the names its own queue would
# have used and returns - so this comparison costs two process starts and cannot
# recurse. That is what makes it a gate row rather than a thing somebody
# remembers to do.
#
# -- ⚠ IT COMPARES SETS, NOT SEQUENCES ---------------------------------------
#
# The two halves schedule differently on purpose - the `sh` half runs its checks
# concurrently and reads verdicts in list order, and the PowerShell half is
# serial - so the ORDER a row appears in is not a fact about what either lane
# runs. What must agree is the set, and a duplicate shows up as a count that does
# not match.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate-rows.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate-rows.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case held, 1 one did not, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
