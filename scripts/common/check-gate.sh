# check-gate.sh - run the whole local gate, in one command, and read every
# exit code from the process that produced it.
#
# The defect this exists to catch is a gate that is a LIST. Part (a) of
# docs/methodology/gate.md names several checks, and a list run by hand is run
# in the order somebody recalls it. ⛔ The session that first wrote this ran its
# gate five times and typed a different subset each time. Nothing failed; the
# gate simply was not the same gate twice.
#
# ⭐ IT DELEGATES. It holds no rules of its own and it is not a second opinion
# about anything. Every verdict here is some other script's, read unpiped.
#
# -- ⛔ A SKIPPED CHECK IS A SKIP, NEVER A PASS -----------------------------
#
# `pwsh`, `jq`, `gh` and `shellcheck` are not on every machine. A runner that
# quietly dropped one and printed green would be the row in
# docs/conventions/forbidden-patterns.md that reads *a step that exits 0 having
# done nothing it was asked to do*.
#
# So a skip is counted, named, and printed on its own line. ⚠ The exit code is
# still 0, because a machine that cannot run a check has not failed it; ⭐ pass
# --strict to make a skip a failure, which is what a CI job should do, since
# there the tools are installed on purpose and a skip means the install broke.
#
# -- ⛔ AND A CHECK THIS HOST CANNOT RUN IS NOT A CHECK THAT BROKE ------------
#
# Those are two different facts and --strict could not tell them apart, which
# made it unusable on the lane that needed it most. Measured on 2026-09-06:
# with check-project rewritten to exit 2, the Windows lane's own invocation
# still exited 0, because it ran without --strict; and it ran without --strict
# because six of its rows are checks Windows genuinely cannot run, so the flag
# would have refused every green tree.
#
# ⭐ So a row is one of two kinds. A DECLARED unavailability is written in the
# runner, with a reason and the entry that owns it, and prints as `n/a`. An
# OBSERVED skip is a check that ran and answered 2, or one whose file is gone,
# and prints as `SKIP`. --strict refuses the second and permits the first, so
# both lanes run strict and a check that quietly stops running turns a lane red
# wherever it happens.
#
# ⚠ --fast counts as declared, because the caller asked for it rather than the
# host failing to supply it. The summary names the two totals separately so a
# run cannot claim a strictness it did not have.
#
# -- ⛔ IT DOES NOT RUN ITSELF, AND THAT IS NOT THEORETICAL ------------------
#
# This runs check-twins.sh, which runs both halves of every pair. ⚠ A version
# of this idea in another repository hit an unbounded recursion with
# check-twins that left twenty stray shells holding their own files open. That
# is the reported symptom; the mechanism here is plain enough that it does not
# need re-deriving. A runner that appears in the pair list runs the comparison
# that runs the runner.
#
# So check-gate is NOT in check-twins.sh's pair list, and check-twins is
# invoked here directly rather than through anything that could re-enter.
# ⚠ The two exclusions are a shared contract: removing one reintroduces the
# hang.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --fast     # skips check-twins
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --strict   # a skip is a failure
#   sh scripts/common/check-gate.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 nothing failed, 1 something failed, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# somebody is editing, so demanding a clean tree would refuse the ordinary case;
# what is refused is a tree the gate itself moved.
#
# ⚠ SO IT SEES THE RUN THAT MAKES THE MESS AND NOT THE ONE AFTER. Measured while
# planting the defect above: the first run over a planted tree went red and the
# second went green, because the droppings the first left were already there when
# the second read its `before`. ⭐ A CI lane starts from a fresh checkout, so
# there it fires every time; on a host that already carries the dirt it does not,

# ⚠ NO PRESENCE TEST LIVES HERE. An earlier version tested `$1` after the

# "not present" and the runner printed a green verdict having executed nothing.
# ⭐ That is the exact defect this script's header is about, produced by the
# script itself on its first run. Presence is decided by the caller, which is
# the only place that knows the path.
# ⭐ THE CHECKS RUN CONCURRENTLY AND THEIR VERDICTS ARE READ IN LIST ORDER.
# Every check here is hermetic - each makes its own scratch directory, binds only
# loopback and reads only the tree - so nothing about running them at once
# changes what any of them answers. What it changes is the wall clock, and that
# multiplies: `check-workflow` runs this whole gate NINE times, so a second saved
# here is nine seconds saved on the lane.
#
# ⚠ MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS CHANGED, because "the gate is slow" is not a place to
# start optimising. On this host the 29 checks took 198 seconds and three of them
# were 183 of it: check-twins 90.7s, check-capture-client 47.9s, check-capture
# 44.6s. Everything else together is under fifteen seconds, so serialising them
# behind those three was the whole cost.
#
# ⛔ THE EXIT CODE IS STILL READ FROM THE PROCESS THAT PRODUCED IT. `wait "$pid"`
# returns that child's status and nothing else's, which is the same guarantee the
# serial form had; a `for` loop over a pipeline's status is what this repository
# refuses, and there is no pipeline here.
#
# ⛔ AND THE ROWS ARE STILL IN LIST ORDER. Each check writes to a log of its own
# and its row is assembled at its own index, so a report cannot come out in the
# order the checks happened to finish - which would make two runs of one tree
# produce two different reports.

#
# ⚠ ci/check-staleness IS IN THIS LIST AND ci/check-workflow IS NOT. They sit in

# this gate, so a runner that listed it would re-enter itself. check-staleness
# runs no gate.
#
# ⛔ THE TWO CAPTURE HARNESSES ARE NOT IN THIS LIST, AND THE BATCH BELOW IS WHY.
# Each drives real sockets against a run deadline, and the first concurrent run
# of this gate turned one of them red: `check-capture` reported *a run that
# recorded no bytes is refused (exit 1, but did not say 'recorded no bytes at
# all')* - a refusal that arrived for a reason the case had not planted - while
# the same harness on the same tree passed alone minutes later. A faster gate
# that is red for no defect is worse than a slow one.
#
# ⚠ RAISING THE DEADLINE WAS TRIED FIRST AND MEASURED, because it looked like the
# cheaper answer: those harnesses wait on the observer's own line, so a bigger
# maximum should be nearly free. ⛔ It is not. Several of their cases are ones the
# deadline itself has to end, so `check-capture` goes from 45 seconds at `3` to
# **79 at `6`** and `check-capture-client` from 48 at `5` to **168 at `20`** -
# more gate time than the whole concurrency saves, paid nine times over by
# `check-workflow`. The numbers live beside each `SECS`.
