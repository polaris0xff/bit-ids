# check-publish.sh - publish to a disposable bare repository, plant every defect
# the publisher exists to refuse, and read the branch back each time.
#
# ⛔ NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A REAL REMOTE. Every case runs against a bare
# repository this script creates in a scratch directory and deletes on exit, so
# the publisher's push path is exercised for real without a network or a
# credential anywhere in it.
#
# -- ⛔ WHAT THE BRANCH LOOKS LIKE AFTER A REFUSAL IS PART OF THE CASE ------
#
# A publisher that refuses loudly and half-pushes anyway is worse than one that
# does neither. Every refusal below checks the commit count on the branch as
# well as the exit code.
#
# -- ⭐ TWO CASES PROVE PROPERTIES THIS PUBLISHER RELIES ON RATHER THAN ITS
#       OWN CODE ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# That git refuses a non-fast-forward push under the refspec this publisher
# uses is a property of git, measured here on this host rather than assumed from
# the manual. And that no force flag has crept into the source is a reading of
# the source itself, because a flag added later would pass every behavioural
# case above it right up until the day two publishers raced.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/publishing/check-publish.sh
#   sh scripts/publishing/check-publish.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case held, 1 one did not, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
