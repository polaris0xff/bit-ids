# publish-data.sh - append an assembled bundle to the data branch, and read the
# branch back before saying it happened.
#
# PUB-02's problem is a publisher that force-pushes, drops prior records, or
# leaves partial output behind. ⛔ Each of those is unrecoverable in a way this
# project cares about specifically: the record that goes is not anywhere else.
#
# -- ⛔ THE APPEND RULE IS CHECKED BEFORE THE PUSH, NOT AFTER --------------
#
# A branch protection setting refuses a force-push and says nothing at all about
# a commit that deletes a file, which is exactly the shape a latest-only
# regeneration takes. So the published branch is fetched, checked out, and
# compared against the bundle with check-store before anything is committed. A
# refusal there ends the run with nothing pushed.
#
# -- ⛔ NO FORCE, AND THAT IS ASSERTED RATHER THAN OMITTED -----------------
#
# git refuses a non-fast-forward push by default, so the guard is that nothing
# re-enables it: no --force, no --force-with-lease, and no leading + on the
# refspec. The refspec is built here and checked for that character before it is
# used, because a caller-supplied one is the door a flag rule does not cover.
#
# -- ⛔ A PUSH IS NOT COMPLETION ------------------------------------------
#
# The branch is fetched again afterwards, checked out into a third directory,
# and compared three ways: that it is byte-for-byte the bundle that was pushed,
# that it still appends to what was there, and that every digest in its own
# SHA256SUMS matches the bytes that came back.
#
# ⛔ THE FIRST OF THOSE THREE WAS MISSING AND A PLANTED REMOTE FOUND IT. A
# post-receive hook that accepted the push and then moved the ref back left a
# branch that still appended to the prior tree perfectly, because it WAS the
# prior tree. "What came back appends to what was there" and "what came back is
# what I pushed" are two facts, and only the second one notices a remote that
# discarded the push.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/publishing/publish-data.sh --bundle DIR --remote URL [--branch B]
#   sh scripts/publishing/publish-data.sh ... --dry-run
#
# --dry-run does everything except the push and the read-back, which is what a
# pull request lane should run.
#
# Exit codes: 0 appended and read back, 1 refused, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
