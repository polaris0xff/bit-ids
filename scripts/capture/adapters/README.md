# Capture adapters

One file per target, and the only thing in this repository that knows how a
particular product is installed, asked its version, started and stopped.

⛔ **An adapter is the seam and never the boundary.** The guards that decide
whether a capture may happen at all live in
[`../../acquisition/assert-disposable.sh`](../../acquisition/assert-disposable.sh)
and are run by
[`../capture-client.sh`](../capture-client.sh) before an adapter is asked to
start anything. An adapter that tried to check the host would be a second
answer to a question one place already answers.

## The contract

Five subcommands. Each reads its arguments positionally, prints to stdout, and
returns 0 for done, 1 for refused and 2 for could-not-run.

| subcommand | when | must |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `describe` | any time | print `target=<slug>` and `kind=stock\|stub`, one per line, plus `binary=<path>` when one is installed and the release-route declarations below when it has one |
| `install <route> <workdir>` | ⛔ **before the route is cut** | install the target through that route alone |
| `version` | ⛔ **before the route runs, again after it, and again under containment** | ⛔ ask the **installed executable** and print exactly what it answered |
| `start <torrent> <workdir> <peer-port>` | under containment | launch the build on that torrent and return; the build keeps running |
| `stop <workdir>` | under containment | stop whatever `start` launched |

⛔ **`kind` is a declaration the attestation copies rather than assumes.** A
`stub` adapter drives every guard `capture-client` has and is not a product, so
a run it drove writes `stock_client=false`. A field that said otherwise would be
the one sentence in the record nothing backs.

⛔ **`version` asks the build.** A version read from a filename, a package index
or the route that installed it is not the build speaking, which is the rule
`E-ACQ-10` states for a record and `capture-client` restates for a run. An
adapter that cannot ask exits 2, and the capture is *could not run* rather than
a fixture.

⛔ **`version` prints the parsed field on stdout and the build's WHOLE answer on
stderr.** Two routes can install builds that report one version and are not one
build: measured on 2026-09-08, Ubuntu's aria2 1.37.0 and a 1.37.0 compiled from
the vendor's own release tarball answer the same version and enable different
features. ⚠ Features are what a build does on the wire, so a record holding only
the version has dropped the evidence that would have separated them. ⭐ stderr
costs nothing to keep: `install-client` writes it to `version.err` beside the
install record and `capture-client` appends it to `adapter.err` inside the
evidence bundle.

⛔ **So `version` is a pure read and is called when the target may not be there
at all.** `install-client` asks it before the route runs, which is how a route
that installed nothing is detected, and a target that is absent then is the
ordinary case rather than an error: exit 2, and the caller records that the host
had nothing. ⚠ An adapter whose `version` started a daemon, wrote a profile or
assumed containment would be changing the host at the one moment the caller is
trying to observe it unchanged. Every shipped adapter runs `<binary> --version`
and nothing else.

⚠ **That is also the limit of "driven over RPC".** `aria2-next` is driven over
its own RPC interface wherever RPC answers the same question, and `version` is
the case where it cannot: `install-client` asks before the route runs, when
nothing is installed and no daemon exists to ask. RPC answers that question
*better* once a build is running - `aria2.getVersion` returns a structured
`version` field rather than a line of prose - and it cannot answer it at all at
the moment the caller needs it.

⛔ **`install` is never called under containment.** By the time a capture runs
there is no route off the host, so an install that needed one would have to
restore egress on the machine that exists to have none.
[`../../acquisition/install-client.sh`](../../acquisition/install-client.sh) is
the caller, and it runs in an earlier workflow step.

## Every call is bounded, and the bound is the caller's

⛔ **An adapter shells out to a product this project did not write, and a product
that waits on a question waits forever.** Measured on 2026-09-08, client capture
run 1: two of its three jobs sat in the install step for over half an hour and
reported nothing at all, because a hung install is indistinguishable from a slow
one until the job's own timeout kills the runner and takes the log with it.

⭐ **So the callers bound every subcommand rather than each adapter bounding
itself.** A convention in each adapter is a bound the next adapter forgets; the
callers are the one place every adapter passes through. `124` is coreutils'
verdict for *it never answered*, and it is reported as its own refusal because
the fix differs from a route that said no.

⛔ **And stdin is `/dev/null` on every call.** A product that asks a question
gets end-of-file rather than a wait. ⚠ That is a second control and not the same
one: it catches a prompt, the time limit catches everything else, and
[`../check-capture-client.sh`](../check-capture-client.sh) proves each with its
own case because a stub blocking on `read` would demonstrate only the redirect.

⚠ **An adapter still owns the switches its own product needs.** Ubuntu's
`needrestart` opens a dialog that `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` does not suppress, and
`qbittorrent-nox` asks for its legal notice to be confirmed - on `--version` as
well as on a run, which is a control on one of two paths into the same product.

## ⛔ The workdir IS the evidence bundle

**Anything an adapter writes into the workdir is uploaded as an artifact.**
`capture-client` calls `stop` and then packs that directory, so a file left
there ships.

⚠ **Which makes rule 12 an adapter rule and not only a repository one.**
Measured on capture-client run 11: `aria2-next` generated a per-run JSON-RPC
token, wrote it to `<workdir>/rpc-token` so `stop` could authenticate its
shutdown, and the token was then inside the uploaded bundle as
`client/rpc-token`. Nothing between those two steps was wrong on its own. ⛔ A
short-lived token, for a loopback port, on a host about to be destroyed, is a
weak secret and rule 12 does not grade them.

⭐ **So an adapter that must persist a secret deletes it in `stop`, before
anything packs the directory** - and writes it under `umask 077` in the
meantime. An adapter that needs no secret should not invent one.

## What an adapter must switch off

⛔ **Public peer discovery, on every route into it.** A capture host has no
default route, so a DHT bootstrap or a tracker on the internet fails rather than
leaks - but a *link-local* announce does not, and neither does anything the host
can still reach. Every adapter disables DHT, peer exchange and local peer
discovery explicitly, and the settings it wrote are part of what the run
records.

⚠ **Three switches, because they are three surfaces.** `OBS-06` calls them
adjacent for exactly this reason: each carries identity and each names a
destination of its own. An adapter that turned off DHT alone would leave the
other two on, which is the one-gated-door shape
[`../../../docs/methodology/reviews.md`](../../../docs/methodology/reviews.md)
calls the most recurring hole there is.

⛔ **Three is this contract's floor and not every product's ceiling, and that
was measured rather than reasoned.** `aria2-next` has a FOURTH:
`bt-port-mapping`, "Enable UPnP and NAT-PMP port mapping", defaults to **true**.
Driven on 2026-09-09 with all three documented switches off, the build was still
bound to **UDP 1900** - SSDP multicast - read out of `/proc` rather than out of
its own report. ⚠ A contained host has no default route, so a tracker or a DHT
bootstrap fails; a multicast to `239.255.255.250` is link-local and does not.

⭐ **So an adapter enumerates its own product's surfaces, and the way to find
them is to run the build and read its sockets.** The help text names the switch
only if you already suspect it; the socket table names it whether or not you do.
⚠ Whether `aria2`, `transmission` and `qbittorrent` have surfaces of their own
that this list does not cover is an open question and not a claim - nothing has
read their sockets this way.

## The routes

⛔ **Two independent routes per target, and `E-ACQ-07`/`E-ACQ-08` are what
refuse a pair that shares a resolver or a delivery mechanism.** `package` is the
host's own package manager, `release` is the vendor's published artifact, and
`source` is a build of the resolved tag. Two package aliases pointing at one
index are one route.

⭐ **`source` was added on 2026-09-09 because a target had no package.** No index
carries `aria2-next`, and the dangerous fallback is that the obvious one
SUCCEEDS: `apt-get install aria2` exits 0 having installed a different product at
a different version. ⚠ The pairing that worked is `release` against `source` -
the vendor's published binary against a build of the same tag - and run 14
measured both at 2.7.5 with different digests.

⛔ **A `source` route resolves its TAG from the same resolution the `release`
route reads its URL from.** Two resolutions per lane would let a vendor whose
newest release moves between two reads hand the two routes different versions,
which is what absolute 4 forbids; sharing one resolution makes them equal rather
than checking it afterwards.

⚠ **AND `source` BESIDE `release` IS WEAKER INDEPENDENCE THAN `package` BESIDE
`release`.** They differ in resolver and in delivery, which is what `E-ACQ-07`
and `E-ACQ-08` compare, and they do NOT differ in origin: whoever controls that
repository controls both. An adapter that has a real package route should prefer
it, and one that does not should say so where the record can see it.

⚠ **A source build is minutes, not seconds, and the caller's bound has to know.**
`aria2-next`'s took 366 seconds on a session host and **496** on a runner - about
1.35x - so a locally measured build time is a lower bound on what a runner needs
and never an estimate of it. The workflow raises `BIT_IDS_INSTALL_TIMEOUT` for
`source` lanes alone.

### The release route's artifact, declared where the target is known

⛔ **A release route needs an artifact chosen and `describe` is where the target
says which.** Five more keys, printed by `describe` and read by
[`../../acquisition/resolve-release.sh`](../../acquisition/resolve-release.sh).
An adapter with no release route prints none of them, which is an answer: the
caller learns this target has no second route rather than watching a fetch fail
with something that names nothing.

| key | is |
| --- | --- |
| `release_repo` | `owner/name`, the repository whose releases the route resolves through |
| `release_tag_prefix` | the literal stripped before a tag is read as a version, or `-` for none |
| `release_min_components` | the fewest dot-separated components a version of this target has |
| `release_max_components` | the most |
| `release_asset` | which artifact of a release is the installable one |

⛔ **They live here because this file is already the only one that knows how
this product is installed**, and they are on `describe` rather than on a sixth
subcommand because both callers already parse `describe` for `binary=`. A second
door into one answer is the shape this repository's reviews call the most
recurring hole there is.

⭐ **`release_asset` is a pattern with two constructs and `{version}` is the one
that matters.** It expands to the version the resolver selected, `*` matches any
run, and everything else is literal. Measured on 2026-09-09 against the live
listings: qBittorrent's release-5.2.3 publishes **fourteen** assets including two
Linux `AppImage` files differing only by an `_lt20`, so
`qbittorrent-*_x86_64.AppImage` matches both, and aria2's release publishes three
source archives differing only in compression, so `aria2-*.tar.*` matches three.
⛔ **Two matches is a refusal, not a first-match answer**: choosing between them
by the order the source listed them is choosing by a property of the source, and
the record would look identical the month that order changed.

⚠ **A declared artifact is not an installable one.** `transmission` declares its
source tarball and its release route still refuses, because nothing here knows
how to build it. That is the honest split: this project can say which file a
route would fetch and cannot say how to compile it, and declaring the first is
what makes the second a named gap rather than a route that is simply unreachable.

⚠ **A route that installs is not yet a route that agreed.** `ACQ-03`'s
same-version gate compares what each installed build *reports*, which is why
`version` asks the executable rather than the installer.

⛔ **And a route that RAN is not yet a route that INSTALLED.** `install-client`
asks `version` and `describe` once before the route runs and once after, and
records `preexisting_version`, both executables, both digests and `acquired`
beside the version.

⛔ **A version is not an identity, which is why `describe` names the
executable.** `aria2` ships on `ubuntu-24.04` at the same version the vendor
publishes, so a release route there installs a genuinely different build - a
2.8-megabyte self-contained program in place of a 14-kilobyte shim over
`libaria2.so.0`, with a different feature list - and both answer `1.37.0`. ⚠ A
verdict on version strings alone calls that no acquisition at all, which is
measured rather than argued: it is what the first two-route capture would have
recorded. The digest is what makes that branch reachable, and it has its own
harness case.

⚠ **An adapter that names no executable is not refused.** The key is omitted when
nothing is installed, the two digest fields come back empty, and the verdict
falls back to the version - a lower bound rather than a wrong answer.

⚠ **Both halves of that are measured rather than imagined.** `aria2` ships on
the `ubuntu-24.04` image, so `apt-get install aria2` there prints `already the
newest version`, installs nothing and exits 0; client capture runs 3 and 4 wrote
`route=package` over exactly that. And every `release` route here fetches its
artifact into the workdir without making it the executable `binary()` finds, so a
release route run after a package route reports the **package** build's version
as its own. ⛔ Two routes in that state declare two independent resolvers, agree
on the version because it is one binary, and reach `ACQ-03` as `byte_identical` -
the strongest verdict the classification has, over an acquisition that never
happened.

⚠ **`acquired=no` is recorded and not refused.** The build on such a host is
real and its identity is worth capturing; what is not real is the claim that this
route acquired it. The refusal belongs to whatever compares two routes, which is
the same reason `install-client` runs one route per call.
