# aria2.sh - the CLIENT-05 capture adapter.
#
# ⭐ THE SIMPLEST TARGET IN THE MATRIX, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS HERE FIRST AMONG
# EQUALS. aria2c takes every setting on its command line, needs no daemon, no
# profile directory and no interactive acceptance, and prints its version to
# stdout. Nothing about a run of it depends on state a previous run left behind,
# which is the property a capture host is built to guarantee and an adapter
# should not also have to.
#
# ⚠ CLIENT-05 ALSO WANTS aria2 AS A CONNECTOR, AND THIS IS NOT THAT. Driving
# aria2 as a target and using it to corroborate another target are the two roles
# the entry says must not create circular corroboration. This file is the target
# half alone; nothing here observes anything.
#
# -- ⛔ WHAT THIS ASSUMES ABOUT THE PRODUCT, AND WHAT IS NOW MEASURED ----------
#
# ⭐ MEASURED on 2026-09-08, against installed aria2 1.37.0 - both an Ubuntu
# package build and one compiled here from the vendor's release tarball.
# Installing a product and asking its version is not a capture, so it needed no
# disposable host:
#
#   * `aria2c --version` opens with `aria2 version 1.37.0`, so the third field
#     is the version - confirmed on both builds;
#   * the package route installs without a prompt, and on `ubuntu-24.04` it
#     installs NOTHING, because the image already ships aria2;
#   * the release route builds: 19 seconds to configure, 126 seconds to
#     `make -j4`, and the result answers with BitTorrent enabled.
#
# ⛔ STILL NOT MEASURED, because each needs a capture:
#
#   * `--enable-dht`, `--enable-dht6`, `--bt-enable-lpd` and
#     `--enable-peer-exchange` are the switches for the three adjacent surfaces;
#   * `--listen-port` refuses zero, which is why an unset peer port drops it;
#   * a torrent as a positional argument makes it announce to the tracker named
#     inside, needing no other control.
#
# ⚠ A claim here that turns out to be wrong shows up as a capture that refuses
# rather than as one that lies: `capture-client` will not attest to a build it
# did not observe announce.
#
# See adapters/README.md for the contract.
#
# Exit codes: 0 done, 1 refused, 2 could not run.
