# check-capture.sh - prove the capture runner refuses what it exists to refuse.
#
# ⛔ A CAPTURE IS WHERE THIS PROJECT WILL RUN SOMEBODY ELSE'S BINARY, and
# `capture-run` is what stands between that and a host with a route off it. Its
# guards are the last ones to fire before that process starts, so they are
# mutation-proven here rather than trusted.
#
# ⚠ WILL, not does. Nothing installs a client yet: `CLIENT-01` owns that, and
# what runs today is this project's own observer driven by `curl`. The guards
# are written for the harder case and proved on the easier one.
#
# -- ⭐ THE CONDITIONS ARE CONSTRUCTED, NOT PLANTED INTO THE SCRIPT -----------
#
# Every case here builds the host state the guard exists to catch: no claim, a
# claim naming another run, a route table with a default route, an unbuilt
# observer, an output directory that already holds a run. That is stronger than
# editing the script and re-running it, because it exercises the guard through
# the same door a real capture would come through.
#
# -- ⭐ EXCEPT FOR THE OBSERVER'S OWN CONTRACT, WHICH NEEDS A FIXTURE ---------
#
# Some refusals are about what the observer REPORTED, and no host state can
# provoke those. A STUB OBSERVER does: it runs the real one, so the socket and
# the driver are real, and then breaks exactly one term of the contract on the
# way out. ⚠ The `lost-token` mode recomputes the digest it prints, because
# otherwise the digest check fires first and the token check is never reached.
# Two guards answering one input is how one of them stops being tested.
#
# -- ⛔ EVERY SHARED EXIT CODE IS SEPARATED BY ITS MESSAGE --------------------
#
# The runner has many more refusals than it has exit codes, so most of these
# cases share one with several others. A case asserting the code alone passes
# when a different refusal fired, which is the defect the Windows guard pair
# shipped and `check-runner.ps1` found. ⚠ No count of them is written here: it
# was, and it was wrong within the hour, because the count is a property of the
# script rather than of this comment. Every case names what the runner said.
#
# -- ⭐ AND THE TWO HALVES ARE COMPARED, WHICH check-twins CANNOT DO ----------
#
# `check-twins.sh` pairs the `common/` checks, and these are not there: they
# take a host and a running process rather than a tree. So the comparison lives
# here. It compares the ATTESTATION KEY SET, because a field in one twin and not
# the other is drift no value comparison can see, and then the facts that
# describe one run. ⚠ It does NOT compare the values that must differ: the two
# halves verify with different readers, on different platform strings, and a
# twin reporting the same value there would be describing a run that did not
# happen.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/capture/check-capture.sh
#   sh scripts/capture/check-capture.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every guard refused its defect, 1 one did not, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
