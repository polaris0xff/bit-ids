# check-connector.sh - does the second connector read the BYTES, and does it
# refuse everything a corroboration must not be built on?
#
# ⛔ WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR IS THE ONE DEFECT A CONNECTOR CAN HAVE THAT LOOKS LIKE
# SUCCESS. A connector that copied the observer's answer, or that read the
# attestation, would agree with the observer on every field of every capture
# forever - and `E-COR-*` would record a corroborated measurement over one
# reading. So the load-bearing case here is not a refusal: it is that MOVING A
# BYTE IN THE TRANSCRIPT MOVES THE REPORT. Everything else guards the edges of
# that.
#
# -- ⭐ WHAT THE CONNECTOR IS AND WHY IT IS PYTHON ----------------------------
#
# `scripts/capture/connectors/cpython-stdlib.py` carries the whole argument in
# its own header, including the three rejected alternatives. In one line: the
# thing being corroborated is this project's Rust reading of these formats, so a
# second reader written in this workspace corroborates nothing.
#
# -- ⚠ WHAT THIS HARNESS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ----------------------------
#
# It binds no socket and starts no observer. The transcripts here are written by
# this file, in the exact shape `bit-ids-lab`'s writer emits, and the CONTROL
# that a real bundle is one the connector accepts belongs where a real bundle
# exists: `check-capture-client` drives the real observer and asserts the report
# the runner wrote into that bundle. Two harnesses, because a socket case in
# here would make a decoder's mutation proofs wait on a deadline.
#
# ⛔ NOTHING HERE PLANTS IN A TRACKED FILE. Every bundle a case mutates is
# written into scratch state.
#
# ⚠ NO VALUE HERE IS ANY PRODUCT'S. The peer-ID prefix is `-XX0000-`, which no
# vendor uses, so nothing this harness writes can be mistaken for a measurement.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/capture/check-connector.sh
#   sh scripts/capture/check-connector.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case held, 1 one did not, 2 could not run.
