"""cpython-stdlib - the second connector, reading a capture bundle's raw bytes.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
================

Absolute 2 says every profile uses the Rust active observer plus at least one
INDEPENDENT connector, and their overlapping observations agree or the profile
stays unpublished with the disagreement recorded. Until this file existed the
project had one reader of every surface, so a record's corroboration column
would have been the observer agreeing with itself.

The contract is `CI-09`'s and it is already proved from the other side: a
connector declared in the attestation's `connectors=` writes
`connector/<id>.txt` into the bundle, one `field_path=value` line per field the
observer measured, where the value is lowercase hex, `absent` or
`out_of_scope`. `assemble-capture` reads it and refuses a declared connector
that is silent about a field.

WHERE THE INDEPENDENCE ACTUALLY IS, STATED RATHER THAN CLAIMED
==============================================================

This reads the same bytes as `bit-ids-probe`, out of the transcript the lab
wrote, and decodes them with implementations this project did not write:

  - the transcript document is read by `json`. The lab SERIALISES it by hand,
    because the field order and the hex case are what a digest names, and it
    parses it back by hand for the same reason. Neither of those had ever been
    read by a conformant JSON reader.
  - the announce target is split by `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and every query
    value is percent-decoded by `urllib.parse.unquote_to_bytes`. That is where
    a peer ID actually lives and it is the decoding most likely to differ:
    `bit-ids-wire` has its own.
  - the request's headers are parsed by `http.client.parse_headers`, which is
    `email.parser` underneath - a header reader with two decades of conformance
    behind it.

  The peer-wire handshake is the weak one and this file will not pretend
  otherwise. It is a fixed layout - a length byte, that many protocol bytes,
  eight reserved, twenty info hash, twenty peer ID - and two readings of it can
  differ only in their bounds checking. The independence there is real and it is
  smaller than on the announce, which is why it is written down here rather than
  left for a reader to assume from the word "connector".

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SHARED WITH THE OBSERVER
=================================================

The observer takes the FIRST `from_target` segment of each transcript and
requires it to parse. This scans EVERY `from_target` segment and identifies the
surface by its content: an announce is a segment that parses as an HTTP request
carrying a `peer_id` query field, and a handshake is one that begins with the
BitTorrent protocol string. Selecting by position would have made the two
readers share a decision, and a record's corroboration would then rest on both
of them having guessed the same segment.

  Two segments that both parse and DISAGREE are refused rather than resolved.
  A connector that took one of two conflicting announces would be manufacturing
  the constant the record is about to declare. Two that agree corroborate each
  other, which is what a client announcing twice actually gives you.

WHY PYTHON, WHEN THIS REPOSITORY'S RULE IS SHELL AND RUST
=========================================================

bit-ids:python-exception=OBS-07


`docs/AGENTS.md` section 5 permits Python only where a documented constraint
makes both unsuitable, and this is that constraint rather than a preference:

  - Rust in this workspace is the reading that is being corroborated. A second
    connector written against `bit-ids-wire` corroborates nothing, and one
    written beside it in the same tree by the same hand is the self-consistency
    `OBS-07`'s Source names.
  - A third-party Rust crate would be independent and would also be a
    dependency of the crate that publishes records, which `docs/supply-chain.md`
    makes this project argue for. The argument is worse: it puts a parser in the
    publisher's own dependency tree to check the publisher.
  - Shell has no HTTP header parser and no percent-decoder. Writing either in
    `awk` reproduces exactly the shared-reading problem above.

  `scripts/README.md` already records the precedent: `check-staleness` re-derives
  a request identifier with `python3`'s SHA-256, "an implementation this project
  did not write". This is the same argument about a bigger surface.

      - A MISSING file means the run recorded no such surface. A capture whose
        target never accepted a peer connection writes no peer transcript, and
        the attestation says so in `peer_streams`. This connector cannot observe
        a surface the bundle does not contain, and `out_of_scope` is exactly
        that: not a value, not an absence, and the reason its silence proves
        nothing. Reporting `absent` instead would be claiming the condition was
        created and the build produced nothing, which is a corroboratable fact
        this connector is in no position to assert.
      - A file that is PRESENT and will not read is refused. Whatever is wrong
        there is wrong with the evidence, and a connector that turned it into
        `out_of_scope` would answer a broken bundle with a shrug.

    The transcript schema declares LOWERCASE hex, and this refuses anything
    else rather than calling `bytes.fromhex`, which accepts either case. The
    rejected alternative was to be permissive: a connector that read a document
    the lab could not have written would be corroborating bytes whose origin it
    had just declined to check.
