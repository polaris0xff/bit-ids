# capture-run.sh - the capture itself, on a host that has already been claimed
# and already had its route off the machine deleted.
#
# ⛔ IT BUILDS NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT.
# By the time this runs there is no network: the workflow deleted the default
# route in both address families before calling it. A capture that discovered a
# missing dependency here would have to restore egress to fix it, which is
# restoring egress to a host running a binary this project downloaded minutes
# ago. So the observer is a path to an ALREADY BUILT binary, and a missing one
# is `could not run` rather than something to repair in place.
#
# -- ⛔ WHAT THIS IS NOT ------------------------------------------------------
#
# It is a FIXTURE capture. Nothing here installs a client, and no stock
# BitTorrent build is observed: `CLIENT-01` owns that and `capture.kind` in the
# attestation says `fixture` so a bundle cannot be mistaken for one. What is
# measured here is the containment and the evidence path, end to end, which is
# `CI-03`'s Prove and not `CLIENT-01`'s.
#
# -- ⭐ THE DRIVER IS A CLIENT THIS PROJECT DID NOT WRITE ---------------------
#
# `curl` is a complete HTTP client, it is on both hosted runner images, and it
# puts real bytes through the tracker observer. A driver written here would be
# this project checking its own reading of HTTP against itself.
#
# ⭐ AND IT SENDS A TOKEN IT KNOWS, so the transcript can be checked against
# what actually happened rather than against what the observer believed. The
# announce carries `key=<run-id>`; the transcript must hold those bytes.
# Without that, an observer that wrote an empty artifact and a bundle that
# verified against its own empty digest would pass every other check here.
#
# -- ⛔ EVERY REFUSAL SAYS SOMETHING DIFFERENT --------------------------------
#
# There are three exit codes and many more refusals, so nearly every one shares
# its code with several others, and two guards answering one code mask each
# other: deleting either leaves every case green because the survivor produces
# the code the case asserts. `check-capture.sh` asserts the MESSAGE on every
# case, not the code alone.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/capture/capture-run.sh --run-id <id> --out <dir> --observer <path>
#                                     [--seconds <n>] [--route-table <path>]
#
# Exit codes: 0 the capture ran and its evidence verifies, 1 a guard refuses,
# 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
