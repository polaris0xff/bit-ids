# check-step-bodies.sh - does a capture workflow's step body do what the runner
# would do with it, INCLUDING ending?
#
# ⛔ NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY RAN A CAPTURE STEP'S BODY, and `CI-06` and
# `CI-08` both recorded that as the gap they could not close.
# `check-workflow.sh` reads `capture.yml`'s step names, their order and the
# *Capture* step's command, and executes steps out of `ci.yml` alone - so the
# two restore blocks were proved statically by `check-project` and dynamically
# only by a dispatch. This is the harness that runs them.
#
# -- ⛔ A STEP DOES NOT END WHEN ITS COMMAND EXITS ----------------------------
#
# The runner reads a step's output through a pipe, so a step is over when the
# command has exited AND that pipe has reached end of file. A process the body
# leaves behind holding the step's stdout keeps the pipe open, and the runner
# goes on waiting for a command that finished. ⚠ Nothing about that is visible
# to an exit code, which is why every existing harness here would call such a
# body green: `check-workflow.sh` runs step bodies with their output redirected
# to a FILE, and a file has no reader to wait on.
#
# ⭐ SO THIS RECORDS TWO FACTS PER BODY AND KEEPS THEM APART: the exit status,
# and whether the output closed. A refusal and a step that will not end are
# different failures, and a harness that reported one number could not say which
# it had.
#
# ⚠ WHY IT IS WORTH THE MACHINERY, measured rather than supposed. Client capture
# runs 6 and 7 ran the SAME aria2 install command, from commits that differ only
# in where a later step sits - `git diff` over the two says so - and the step
# took **six seconds** in one and had not returned after sixteen minutes in the
# other. A command whose duration depends on which step follows it is not a
# command that is slow. `CI-08` carries the open question; this is the
# instrument.
#
# -- WHAT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH ------------------------------------------------
#
# ⚠ This host is not a runner image, and a body that ends here is not a body
# that ends there. What it proves is the SHAPE: that a body leaving a process on
# the step's output does not end, that these bodies do not, and that the run-1
# defect reproduces under GitHub's own wrapper form.
#
# ⚠ AND ONLY THE STEPS A SESSION HOST CAN EXECUTE. The claim writes under
# /var/lib, the cut deletes a default route, and the capture needs both; the
# guards and the product are stubbed here, so what runs is the workflow's own
# block over a stub rather than a capture.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/ci/check-step-bodies.sh
#   sh scripts/ci/check-step-bodies.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case held, 1 one did not, 2 could not run.

# ⛔ HOW LONG A PLANTED LEAK HOLDS THE PIPE, AND IT IS A RACE THIS HARNESS LOST.
# The leaking process is spawned INSIDE the body, and the pipe is only examined
# after the body has exited plus `CLOSE_SECONDS`. So a plant only proves what it
# claims while
#
#     leak duration  >  body duration + CLOSE_SECONDS
#
# ⚠ It was `sleep 8` written as a literal at every use, which is ample for the
# two `probe` cases - their bodies are `echo` and `exit 0` - and marginal for the
# install-block case, whose body is the whole *Install the client* step: a
# `timeout` around `install-step.sh`, which runs `install-client` under `sudo`, a
# watchdog loop and a bounded holder report. ⛔ Measured on 2026-09-09: inside a
# full gate run, where twenty-nine checks run concurrently, that body ran long
# enough for the eight seconds to expire before the pipe was looked at, and the
# case reported `the output closed, so the planted hang did not happen` - a red
# row over a tree with no defect in it. Three gate runs went red that way before
# one was captured with its per-case output.
#
# ⭐ FORTY-FIVE, AND THE MARGIN IS THE POINT RATHER THAN THE NUMBER. The failure
# needs the body to reach about five seconds; this leaves roughly forty of slack,
# so the case now measures the redirection it is about instead of the host's load.
# ⚠ THE COST IS STATED: a `sleep` orphan can outlive the check by up to this many
# seconds, where the old value bounded that at eight. It exits on its own, it
# holds only a scratch pipe, and a row that is red at random is worse.
LEAK_SECONDS=45

# ⛔ AND A ZERO BOUND IS NOT A TIGHT BOUND, IT IS NO BOUND AT ALL. coreutils
