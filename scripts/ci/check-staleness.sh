#!/bin/sh
# check-staleness.sh - drive CI-02's monitor over real stores and real
# resolutions, and read back what it opened.
#
# ⛔ EVERY CASE GOES THROUGH THE RESOLVER. The entry's Prove asks for no request
# over a preview, and a harness that handed the survey a stable version and
# observed no preview request would prove nothing at all: no preview was
# present. So each case writes the release list a source would answer with, runs
# resolve-stable over it, and surveys what that decided.
#
# ⛔ THE INPUTS ARE PLANTED, NOT THE SOURCE. check-store.sh and check-corpus.sh
# plant into a tree because their guards are about trees. This unit's guards are
# about a comparison, so the plant is a different store, a different release
# list or a different tracker state, and every case declares the exit code and
# the verdict it expects. The source-level guard mutation over staleness.rs is
# part (c) of the gate and is recorded in TODO/ci.md.
#
# ⭐ CASE 1 AND CASE 2 ARE EACH OTHER'S CONTROL. They differ only in whether the
# tracker is handed the request the first one opened. A detection that never
# fired would fail case 2; one that always fired would fail case 1. Neither is
# provable from one run.
#
# -- ⚠ WHY THIS IS IN scripts/ci/ AND IN THE GATE -----------------------------
#
# check-workflow.sh is the other file here and is deliberately NOT in the gate,
# because two of its cases run the gate. This one runs no gate and re-enters
# nothing, so it is in check-gate.sh's prover list with the corpus and
# publishing harnesses.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/ci/check-staleness.sh
#   sh scripts/ci/check-staleness.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case held, 1 one did not, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
