#!/bin/sh
# check-workflow.sh - does the workflow actually go red for each class of
# defect it is supposed to catch?
#
# CI-01's Prove has two halves. One is that every required check appears as a
# non-skipped CI result, which is what check-gate's --strict answers now that a
# declared unavailability and an observed skip are counted apart. This is the
# other half: an injected failure in docs, schema, fixtures or Rust turns the
# workflow red.
#
# -- ⛔ EVERY COMMAND IT RUNS IS READ OUT OF THE WORKFLOW -------------------
#
# Nothing here spells a build command. A harness carrying its own copy of
# `cargo test --workspace --locked --all-targets` proves that command refuses a
# defect and says nothing whatever about the one CI runs, and the two would
# drift in the direction that keeps this file green. So a case names a JOB and a
# STEP, the command is pulled from .github/workflows/ci.yml, and ⭐ A STEP THIS
# FILE NAMES AND THE WORKFLOW NO LONGER HAS IS A FAILURE, never a silent pass.
# That is the same defect docs/methodology/reviews.md calls two spellings of one
# layout, and CORPUS-01 paid for it twice.
#
# -- ⛔ IT IS NOT IN check-gate.sh, AND THAT IS A SHARED CONTRACT -----------
#
# Two of the cases below run the workflow's own *Repository gate* step, which is
# check-gate.sh. A runner that appears in the gate and also runs the gate
# recurses, which is precisely why check-gate.sh keeps check-twins out of its
# own pair list. ⚠ Removing this exclusion reintroduces the hang. The workflow
# runs this file as its own step instead, so it still runs on every push, and
# scripts/README.md carries the reasoning beside check-twins'.
#
# -- ⛔ THE TREE IT PLANTS IN IS THE TREE ON DISK ---------------------------
#
# It copies the tracked and untracked working tree into a scratch directory and
# commits it there, rather than checking out HEAD. A harness that tested the
# last commit would report green over a defect somebody had just introduced and
# not yet committed, which is the state every pre-push run is in.
#
# ⚠ THE PLANTS AND THE CONTROLS ARE BOTH REQUIRED. A command that refuses the
# planted tree proves nothing unless it accepts the clean one: a step that is
# broken for an unrelated reason refuses everything, and reads here as a guard
# working perfectly.
#
# Usage:

# -- 8b. the three rules over a workflow's own pwsh blocks --------------------
#
# ⛔ THE RULES THE FIRST DISPATCH BOUGHT. check-project's three PowerShell rules
# iterated `git ls-files '*.ps1'` and so never reached a `pwsh` block inside a
# workflow, which is the same language with the same hazards; and the third rule
# below exists only here, because only here does a harness read whatever
# $LASTEXITCODE the block left behind.
#
# ⚠ EACH PLANT GOES INTO THE STEP THAT ACTUALLY BROKE. Capture run 1's Windows
# job restored the route, the inverted egress guard refused as designed, and the
# step failed on that refusal's exit code - so the evidence upload was skipped
# over a guard doing its job. These are the plants that would have caught it.
# ⭐ EACH PLANT IS A WHOLE WORKFLOW RATHER THAN AN EDIT TO capture.yml, for two
# reasons that are not style. `replace_once` refuses a multi-line literal
# outright - that is CORPUS-01's grep -F finding made structural - and every
# needle here is a line whose neighbours are what make it a defect. And a
# purpose-built file exercises the rules' SCOPE: they read every workflow, not
# the one this harness happens to know about.
#
# ⚠ THE PLANT IS UNTRACKED IN THE SCRATCH REPOSITORY, which is deliberate. An
# uncommitted new workflow is part of the tree the next push carries, so the
# rules enumerate `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` beside the tracked
# set; a rule that read only the tracked set would pass over exactly this file.
#
# ⚠ NO `uses:` LINE ANYWHERE IN THESE. The action-pin rule globs the workflow
# directory rather than asking git, so an unpinned plant would turn the gate red
# for a reason that is not the rule under test - and the accepted cases below
# would break outright.
