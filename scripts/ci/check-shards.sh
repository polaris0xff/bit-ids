# check-shards.sh - do the N shards together run every unit exactly once?
#
# `CI-10` sharded `check-workflow` across runners, and its own residual named the
# failure mode before the work started:
#
#   ⛔ *A shard selector that silently claimed no case would report a faster green
#   run over less work, which is this repository's oldest defect class and the one
#   a wall-clock target makes most tempting.*
#
# ⭐ SO THE PARTITION IS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, and it is checked the cheap
# way: `check-workflow --units` lists the names and runs nothing, so every
# assertion here costs one process start rather than a gate run. ⚠ That is the
# same argument `check-gate-rows` makes about the two gate runners' row lists -
# the expensive thing and the thing worth comparing are not the same thing.
#
# -- ⛔ THE THREE PROPERTIES, AND WHY NONE OF THEM IS THE OTHER --------------
#
#   COVERAGE     every unit is claimed by some shard. A unit no shard claims is a
#                rule that stops running while every lane stays green.
#   DISJOINTNESS every unit is claimed by at most one shard. Duplication is not a
#                correctness defect, it is a wall-clock one, and it hides in a
#                green run exactly as well as a gap does.
#   THE CONTROLS every shard runs all of them. ⛔ A shard carrying only plants
#                goes GREEN over a tree where every step is broken, because a
#                plant that is refused proves nothing unless the clean tree is
#                accepted.
#
# ⚠ A run that checked only the first would pass over a selector that ran
# everything in every shard, which is a partition of nothing and N times the work.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/ci/check-shards.sh
#   sh scripts/ci/check-shards.sh --json
#
# Exit codes: 0 every N partitions, 1 one does not, 2 could not run.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.

# -- ⛔ the coupling sharding creates, which no partition check would see ------
#
# ⛔ A VARIABLE ASSIGNED IN ONE UNIT AND READ IN ANOTHER IS A UNIT THAT ONLY WORKS
# WHEN ITS NEIGHBOUR RAN. The partition above can be perfect and every shard still
# die, because the two units land on different runners. ⚠ Measured on 2026-09-10,
# on the first real shard ever driven: `--shard 1/4` exited 2 on
# `PUBWF: parameter not set`, because the publisher's path was assigned inside
# `publisher-trigger` and read inside `static-readers`. A second, `LIB`, was
# assigned in `rust-nocompile` and read by two more units.
#
# ⭐ IT WAS LOUD ONLY BECAUSE OF `set -u`. Without it the path would have been an
# empty string, `[ -f "" ]` would have been false, and the case would have
# reported the publisher workflow missing - a plausible-looking failure naming the
# wrong thing entirely, or worse, a branch that quietly passed.
#
# ⚠ THIS IS A STATIC READ AND IT SAYS SO. It matches assignments and expansions of
# upper-case names by text, so a name built at runtime is outside what it can see.
# What it covers is the shape both instances had.
# ⚠ THE TEST IS "READS A NAME IT NEVER ASSIGNS", not "another unit also assigns
# it". Two units that each set and use their own `MISSING` share a spelling and
# nothing else, and a first version of this reported exactly that as a coupling.
# ⭐ A false positive here is not harmless: it is a red row that teaches a reader
# to stop believing the row.
