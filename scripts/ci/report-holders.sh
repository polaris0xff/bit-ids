# report-holders.sh - which processes still hold an open descriptor on a file?
#
# ⛔ A STEP DOES NOT END WHEN ITS COMMAND EXITS. A runner reads a step's output
# through a pipe and the step is over when the command has gone AND that pipe
# has reached end of file, so a process the step left behind holding its output
# keeps the runner waiting on work that finished.
# [`check-step-bodies.sh`](check-step-bodies.sh) is what proves that shape; this
# is what NAMES the process on a host where it happens.
#
# ⚠ IT IS A DIAGNOSTIC AND ITS SUBJECT IS ANOTHER PROCESS, so it reports and
# never refuses: a step that went red because its diagnostic found nothing would
# replace a missing answer with a wrong one. Exit 0 means it looked; exit 2 means
# it could not, which is a different fact and is said out loud.
#
# ⚠ IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO READ OTHER PROCESSES' DESCRIPTORS. An install that ran
# under sudo leaves root-owned processes, and an unprivileged reader gets nothing
# from their `/proc` entries - reporting "nobody holds it" over a file three root
# processes are holding. Run it as the same user the work ran as.
#
# Usage:
#   sh scripts/ci/report-holders.sh <path> [<path>...]
#
# Exit codes: 0 it looked and said what it found, 2 it could not look.
#
# ⛔ Read the exit code from this process, unpiped.
