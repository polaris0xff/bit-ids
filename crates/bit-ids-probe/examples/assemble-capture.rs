//! Assemble the artifacts a dispatched capture left into records in a store.
//!
//! ```text

//!     --lane CAPTURE_DIR,INSTALL_DIR [--lane CAPTURE_DIR,INSTALL_DIR]... STORE_DIR
//! ```
//!
//! `CI-09`. A dispatched `capture-client` run uploads two artifacts per lane:
//! the capture bundle, which carries the attestation, the generated metainfo and
//! one transcript per surface, and the install artifact, which carries the
//! install record, the release resolution and the bytes the build printed when
//! it was asked its version. This reads a lane of each and writes the
//! [`Profile`] they support.
//!
//! ⚠ **It does NOT write the [`RunManifest`](bit_ids::RunManifest) that has to
//! sit beside a record**, and that is a declared gap rather than an oversight. A
//! manifest carries the run's ordered phases, both clocks, the sampling plan and
//! the host facts; an attestation carries a start, a finish, a platform string
//! and a claim fingerprint, and inventing the rest would be a document `bind`
//! then compares against a record that agrees with it for no reason. `CI-09`
//! carries it.
//!
//! # ⛔ Every field is derived from an artifact, and a field with no artifact is
//! a refusal
//!
//! **Nothing here invents a value to get a record past a gate.** That matters
//! most for the two fields `E-ACQ-07` and `E-ACQ-08` compare: the resolver is
//! read out of the resolution document's own source identifier and the delivery
//! out of the route the adapter ran, so two lanes that really did resolve
//! through one listing produce two routes naming one resolver and are refused.
//! ⚠ Deriving a resolver from the *lane* instead would manufacture exactly the
//! independence those codes exist to check, and the record would look correct.
//!
//! # ⛔ One capture is one record, and both routes are in both records
//!
//! `E-ACQ-01` needs two routes and `Capture::observed_route` names which one's
//! install was put on the wire. So two lanes of one target and one version are
//! **two** records over the **same** route list, differing in their capture and
//! in which route each watched - which is the pair
//! [`classify_across`](bit_ids::classify_across) compares, and the only input
//! shape that can reach `BuildEquivalent` rather than `Unresolved`.
//!
//! # What it prints
//!
//! Every refusal, with its code, the document it came from and the artifact the
//! value was read out of. A run that cannot produce a record says exactly what
//! the capture path would have to record for it to.
//!
//! Exit codes: 0 the store was written, 1 a record was refused, 2 an artifact
//! could not be read.
