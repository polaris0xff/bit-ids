//! The run manifest: how a capture was produced, and from what.
//!
//! A profile says what a build put on the wire. This says what was running when
//! it did: which host, how isolated, which tools at which versions, which
//! phases in which order, what was retrieved from where, and what was scrubbed
//! out of the evidence before it was kept. Without it a profile is a
//! conclusion nobody can replay.
//!
//! It is a separate document from the profile, living beside the raw bytes it
//! describes. The two overlap deliberately, and [`bind`] is what stops the
//! overlap from drifting: a value in two places with nothing checking that they
//! agree is the copy a reader trusts being the wrong one.
