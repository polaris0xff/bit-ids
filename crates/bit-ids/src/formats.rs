//! The consumer-facing renderings of the published record set.
//!
//! `PUB-01` assembles a release and `CORPUS-03` derives the lookups over it.
//! This is the third thing a consumer reads: the records themselves, in the
//! shapes a reader can actually consume. `PUB-03` owns it.
//!
//! ⛔ **THE RECORD SET IS ASKED FOR, NEVER RE-SELECTED.** Which records belong
//! in a published view is one rule and it lives in [`crate::index`]: only
//! publishable ones, and never one something corrects. A second selection here
//! would drift, and it would drift in the direction that publishes a retracted
//! measurement in the tabular view while the lookups had stopped naming it,
//! which is the shape `docs/methodology/reviews.md` calls a gate on one of two
//! doors.
//!
//! ⛔ **THE COMBINED JSON CARRIES EACH RECORD'S OWN BYTES.** The array elements
//! are the canonical documents verbatim rather than re-indented copies, so a
//! reader who slices one out has exactly the bytes that were published and
//! digested. Re-rendering them would be a second spelling of the record model,
//! which is what `canonical.rs` refuses for values and what this refuses for
//! documents.
//!
//! ⚠ **JSONL AND CBOR ARE DERIVED FROM THE CANONICAL DOCUMENT, NOT FROM THE
//! TYPE.** Both need a shape the canonical form does not have: one line, and a
//! binary encoding. Each is produced by reading the canonical document back and
//! re-emitting it, so neither can carry a field the published JSON does not.
//! `E-FMT-02` is the check that the read-back agrees.
//!
//! ⚠ **CSV IS LOSSY AND SAYS SO IN A FILE RATHER THAN IN PROSE.** A tabular row
//! cannot hold the acquisition routes, the observations, the corroboration or
//! the evidence list, so the columns and the omitted sections are published
//! beside it. A consumer that reads only the CSV can then discover what it is
//! not being told without reading this comment.
//!
//! ⭐ **THE QUERYABLE RENDERING IS THE ONE THAT IS BOTH INDEXED AND LOSSLESS**,
//! and [`crate::sqlite`] owns it: it tabulates every list the CSV omits, keeps
//! each record's canonical bytes beside them, and says what it does not carry in
//! a table of its own rather than in a second file. ⚠ It is also the only
//! rendering here that needs a third-party encoder, which is why it is a module
//! rather than a section of this one.
