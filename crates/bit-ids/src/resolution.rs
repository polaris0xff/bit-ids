//! Choosing the newest stable release, and keeping the reasoning.
//!
//! ⛔ **Version strings are not comparable in general, and a resolver that
//! pretends otherwise picks the wrong build silently.** Sorting tags as text
//! puts `4.1.10` before `4.1.9` and `release-5.2.3` before `release-5.2.10`. A
//! channel label is no better: a project can publish a preview without setting
//! the flag, and one that does set it can still tag a release the label calls
//! stable and the version string calls a beta.
//!
//! So nothing here guesses. A target declares how it spells versions, the
//! resolver compares only what that scheme can order, and anything it cannot
//! order **blocks the resolution** rather than being skipped.
//!
//! ⭐ **The skip is the dangerous case and it is worth being explicit about.**
//! An unrecognised tag that is quietly ignored does not produce an error; it
//! produces an older version, selected confidently, with nothing in the record
//! saying a newer one was seen and not understood. Every candidate is kept with
//! the verdict it got, so the resolution is a decision anyone can re-derive.
//!
//! ⚠ **Stability is judged pessimistically, by both signals.** A candidate that
//! either source or version text calls a prerelease is not stable. Being wrong
//! that way costs a skipped release; being wrong the other way publishes a
//! preview build as the stable one, which is a measurement about a build no
//! user runs.
