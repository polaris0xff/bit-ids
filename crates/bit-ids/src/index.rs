//! `CORPUS-03` owns this. A consumer wants to go from something it saw on the

//! release, without opening every record in the store.
//!
//! ⛔ **These are derived files and never authoritative.** Every row names the
//! record it came from, so a reader who doubts a row can open the record and
//! decide from the measurement. An index that answered a question the records

//!
//! ⛔ **Nothing here maps a peer-ID prefix to a client name from a table.** The
//! key of a peer-prefix row is the fixed span of a peer ID *this project

//! `docs/architecture.md` section 5 forbids the decoder table, and this is its
//! opposite: the lookup exists because the measurement does.
//!
//! ⚠ **Only publishable records enter a view.** A provisional record belongs in
//! the store and its disagreement is the evidence, but a lookup that answered
//! with one would publish the claim the record model refused to publish.
//! [`build`] reports how many it left out, because a count with no denominator
