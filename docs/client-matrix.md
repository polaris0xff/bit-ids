# Client matrix

This is the human-readable scope. The machine-readable home is
[`../catalogue/clients.toml`](../catalogue/clients.toml). Candidate routes are
hypotheses for `ACQ-*` work, not claims that the requested version is currently
available there.

## Priority evidence

The August 2026 TorrentAnalytics page was read on 2026-09-04 through the
operator-specified read proxy after the direct fetch route was unavailable. It
reports connection share from DHT discovery followed by TCP handshakes. The
requested families appear as qBittorrent 48.71%, uTorrent 13.41% plus a
separate `uTorrent` row at 3.12%, BitComet 5.35%, libtorrent 3.94% plus
`libTorrent` 2.05%, Transmission 3.19%, Zona 2.66%, Deluge 2.13%, BitTorrent
1.97%, BiglyBT 1.67%, Tixati 1.49%, qBittorrent Enhanced 0.73%, KTorrent 0.62%,
FDM 0.23%, rqbit 0.03% and aria2 0.01%.

Those labels are reproduced as the source presented them; similar-looking rows
are not merged. The page cannot establish which implementation produced an
unknown prefix. Its passive method makes it prioritization evidence only.

Wikipedia's usage-share page, read the same day, has a newest table from March
2020. It corroborates that most named applications have long-standing visible
usage, but it is not current market-share evidence.

## Application targets

| id | platforms | licence class | candidate route A | candidate route B | entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qbittorrent` | Linux, Windows | open source | vendor/GitHub-linked release artifact | distro/WinGet/Flatpak package | `CLIENT-01` |
| `qbittorrent-enhanced` | Linux, Windows | open source fork | GitHub release | community package registry | `CLIENT-02` |
| `utorrent` | Windows | proprietary | vendor installer | WinGet/community package | `CLIENT-03` |
| `bitcomet` | Windows | proprietary | vendor installer | package registry | `CLIENT-04` |
| `aria2` | Linux, Windows | open source | GitHub release | distro/WinGet package | `CLIENT-05` |
| `aria2-next` | Linux, Windows | open source fork | its own GitHub release ⭐ | source build at the matching tag ⭐ | `CLIENT-14` |
| `transmission` | Linux, Windows where supported | open source | upstream release/build | distro/WinGet package | `CLIENT-06` |
| `deluge` | Linux, Windows | open source | upstream/PyPI release | distro/Windows package | `CLIENT-07` |
| `bittorrent` | Windows | proprietary | vendor installer | package registry | `CLIENT-08` |
| `biglybt` | Linux, Windows | open source | GitHub release | distro/package registry | `CLIENT-09` |
| `tixati` | Linux, Windows | proprietary freeware | vendor package | package registry | `CLIENT-10` |
| `ktorrent` | Linux | open source | KDE/Flatpak release | distro package | `CLIENT-11` |
| `fdm` | Linux, Windows | proprietary | vendor package | package registry | `CLIENT-12` |
| `zona` | Windows | proprietary | vendor package | package registry if independently verifiable | `CLIENT-13` |

An entry does not weaken the two-route rule when a candidate disappears. It
records three routes considered, keeps the target open and moves to the next
unblocked client.

⚠ **The `aria2` row names `CLIENT-05` and that is no longer where the first
capture is attempted.** Ten dispatches of that target produced no capture at all,
so by operator direction on 2026-09-09 `CLIENT-14` carries the attempt through a
different upstream, acquired from its own releases and driven over RPC.

⭐ **`aria2-next` has a row now because it has been measured.** The paragraph
here used to say it joins this table "when `CLIENT-14` starts rather than when it
was filed", and on 2026-09-09 it started: the target was listed, fetched,
verified against the vendor's own digests, installed in 1.2 seconds, asked its
version and driven over JSON-RPC. `CLIENT-14` carries every measurement.

⭐ **BOTH OF ITS ROUTES ARE MEASURED, WHICH NO OTHER ROW CAN SAY.** The ⭐ marks
them: `capture-client` run 14 acquired this target through both on two hosts, and
both installed **2.7.5** with different binary digests. ⚠ Every other row's two
columns are candidates - that is what this table's columns are for - and these
two are not.
⛔ **It took a source build because no package index carries this fork**, which
was measured rather than assumed, and because the obvious fallback succeeds:
`apt-get install aria2` exits 0 having installed a different product.
⚠ **That pairing is weaker independence than a package index against a vendor
release** - different resolver and delivery, same origin - and `CLIENT-14` says
so. ⛔ Two routes make a record writable and not publishable: `E-PUB-02` keeps a
measured field provisional while one connector could see it, and both lanes used
one.

⚠ **And a correction about how this table is held to the catalogue.** It said
the target set is "pinned by `check-project` against the catalogue in both
directions", and it is not: `check-project` carries a **list of ids** and asks
that each appear in the catalogue *and* in this table. A target added to the
catalogue and forgotten here is not caught by anything, in either half of the
check. ⭐ `aria2-next` is on that list, so this row and its catalogue entry are
pinned to each other; the general claim was wrong and is withdrawn rather than
restated.

## Library targets

| id | harness | route A | route B | entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `libtorrent` | minimal Rust/C++ or Python-binding client pinned to one stable libtorrent | package registry/system package | matching GitHub tag | `ENGINE-01` |
| `anacrolix-torrent` | minimal Go client using `github.com/anacrolix/torrent` | Go module proxy | matching GitHub tag | `ENGINE-02` |
| `rqbit` | minimal Rust client using the stable rqbit/librqbit release | crates.io package | matching GitHub tag | `ENGINE-03` |

Library harnesses are not allowed to choose an identity value for convenience.
The profile records both library version and harness commit, and the observer
measures what the built harness actually emits.

## Platform rule

Capture every platform a stable upstream release genuinely supports and the
project can acquire twice. Windows-only software stays Windows-only. A missing
Linux row is not filled by Wine unless Wine itself becomes a separately named
platform/packaging dimension.
