# The capture host

What a machine must be before this project installs a client on it, and what
refuses one that is not.

A capture runs a binary this project downloaded minutes earlier, from a vendor
it does not control, and points it at a network. That is the whole product and
it is also the one thing that can go wrong outside a record. Everything here
exists so the blast radius is a machine nobody keeps.

## The boundary is before the install, not in the record

⛔ **`E-MAN-30` refuses to record a capture whose host was not disposable. It
cannot stop one.** By the time a manifest exists, an untrusted installer has
already run somewhere. A record-layer refusal is a report.

So the boundary is
[`../scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.sh`](../scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.sh),
which runs before anything is installed, and which
[`../scripts/acquisition/check-runner.sh`](../scripts/acquisition/check-runner.sh)
mutation-proves on every gate.

## Two guards, and why they are not one

| guard | refuses | independent because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--claim` | a host that already ran a capture | it detects a survived host whatever the configuration claims |
| `--egress` | a host that can reach anything but loopback | it reads the routing table, which no claim can talk it out of |

A fresh host with an open route leaks the capture onto the public network. A
firewalled host that already ran a capture contaminates this one with the last
one's state. Neither guard implies the other, and
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) section 5 requires both before any client is installed.

### The claim detects the failure rather than trusting the claim

⛔ **The obvious design is a token the provisioner writes saying "this host is
disposable", and it is the wrong one.** A promise is exactly what fails
silently: a runner misconfigured to persist its disk still carries the token,
still says disposable, and nothing notices until two captures share state.

So `--claim` writes a marker and refuses if one is already there. A second
capture on one host means the host survived the first, which means it was never
disposable whatever anything claimed. The evidence is the marker's existence,
and a misconfiguration cannot produce its absence.

⚠ **The marker lives in `/var/lib`, and that is load-bearing.** `/run` and
`/tmp` are cleared by a reboot, so a host that rebooted rather than being
destroyed would read as fresh.

The manifest records the guard's answer in `isolation.claim`: the fingerprint it
read and when it claimed the host. `E-MAN-33` refuses a claim stamped after the
run started, because a guard that ran after the install is a report again.

### The egress guard asks the kernel, not the network

⛔ **Nothing probes a third party.** Reaching out from a machine this guard
exists to establish is contained would be exactly the wrong order. It reads
`/proc/net/route` and looks for a default route that is up.

⚠ **POSIX awk only.** The first version used `and(strtonum(...))`, which are
gawk extensions. On a POSIX awk they are undefined functions, awk exits
non-zero, and the guard reported "could not establish" over a machine that
plainly had a default route. It failed closed, which is the right direction, but
a guard that cannot run on a minimal image does not run where it matters most.

## Reading the guards' output

Both guards print the input they trusted: `--egress` names the routing table it
read and `--claim` names the marker it wrote. The routing table is an optional
argument and the marker directory an environment variable, so the runner test
can drive them against fixtures.

⚠ **A seam a test can use is a seam a misconfiguration can use.** Printing the
input is what makes a run that passed over a fixture visible in a log rather
than indistinguishable from one that passed over the machine.

⛔ **`--marker` prints where the claim marker lives, and is the only derivation
of that path.** A later step that wants to know whether this host was claimed,
and by which run, reads the file this names. `capture-run` is the caller it
exists for: it re-reads the claim at the moment of capture rather than trusting
that an earlier workflow step ran. A caller that composed the path itself would
be a second spelling, and it would go on reading the old place the day the state
directory moves - reporting a host nobody claimed as claimed.

## Linux runner contract

1. The host is created for one capture and destroyed after it. Not reset, not
   reimaged in place: destroyed.
2. Before any download or install: `assert-disposable.sh --claim <run-id>` and
   `assert-disposable.sh --egress`, both exit 0. Exit 2 is not a pass.
3. No route off the host except the loopback endpoints the run starts itself.
   A run that needs more records why, and `E-MAN-31` refuses one that does not.
4. No credential of any kind is present. The run needs none: everything it
   fetches is public, and
   [`security/secrets.md`](security/secrets.md) is the rule.
5. The account running the client owns nothing that outlives the host.
6. After the run, the host is destroyed. ⚠ On Linux the next job's
   `--fingerprint` then differs; on Windows it does not, and the paragraph after
   next says why.

⚠ **A fingerprint is comparable only against one the same half produced.** The
two guards digest different inputs, so a Linux job and a Windows job report
different values for one machine and would report different values for two. A
workflow comparing across platforms would read "a fresh host" from nothing at
all. Compare a Linux job's against the previous Linux job's.

⛔ **And on a hosted Windows runner the comparison answers nothing.** Measured by
`CI-06` across two dispatches: two Windows jobs on two hosts that were both fresh
reported the **same** fingerprint, while the two Linux jobs reported different
ones. The hosts really were fresh - each run's claim succeeded, so the marker the
previous run wrote was gone.

⭐ **That is structural rather than a defect to patch.** A fingerprint has to do
two things at once: differ between two hosts, and survive a reboot within one, so
that a machine which rebooted instead of being destroyed still reads as itself.
Every input with the second property is a property of the **image**, and hosted
runners are clones of one image, so on Windows the two requirements have no
common solution. ⚠ Adding a per-boot value would buy the first by destroying the
second, which is the failure the whole guard exists to catch.

⛔ **The claim marker is the guard that actually answers it**, and always was: it
detects a survived host by finding its own marker rather than by comparing a
value against a previous run's. The fingerprint is an image identity recorded
beside the measurement, and on Linux it happens to be a freshness signal too.

## Windows runner contract

The same six rules, and
[`../scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.ps1`](../scripts/acquisition/assert-disposable.ps1)
is the pair that enforces them. `-Claim` writes an exclusively created marker
under `ProgramData`, which survives a reboot so a host that rebooted rather than
being destroyed still reads as claimed; `-Egress` reads `Get-NetRoute`;
`-Fingerprint` digests the machine GUID with the install identity and the
computer name.

⛔ **Both address families are checked.** A host with IPv4 unplugged and IPv6 up
still reaches the internet, and a guard reading only `0.0.0.0/0` would pass it.

⚠ **`-RouteTable` makes the routing source a file**, which is how
[`check-runner.ps1`](../scripts/acquisition/check-runner.ps1) proves the logic on
a machine that has no `Get-NetRoute`. ⭐ **That the real cmdlet's output matches
those fixtures is measured rather than assumed**: the guard ran with no
`-RouteTable` on a hosted `windows-2025` runner whose default routes had just
been removed, and answered `no route off this host (read Get-NetRoute)`. `CI-06`
is the dispatch that established it.

## The workflow that runs on such a host

[`../.github/workflows/capture.yml`](../.github/workflows/capture.yml) is the
only thing that runs a capture on a hosted runner, and `CI-03` owns it. One job
per platform, and the step order is the containment:

| step | why it is where it is |
| --- | --- |
| claim the host | first, before anything else writes to it: the claim detects a survived host by finding its own marker, and a step that left state earlier would not be detected |
| build the observer | ⛔ **while the network still exists.** After the next step nothing can be fetched |
| cut the route off this host | both address families, with the routes saved first |
| assert containment | the guard reads the kernel, not the step above. Those are two facts and only the second is evidence |
| capture | `capture-run` re-reads the marker and the routing table itself |
| restore the route | only to upload, after the measurement is on disk. ⛔ Every path through it ends in an explicit `exit`, because the step's status is otherwise whatever the block left behind |
| upload the evidence bundle | `if-no-files-found: error`, so an upload that found nothing is red |
| report the host fingerprint | compared against the previous run **of the same platform**, and on Windows that comparison answers nothing |

⛔ **There is no `pull_request` trigger and that absence is the fork guard.** A
fork cannot cause a workflow to run in the base repository, so there is no
job-level condition for anyone to weaken and no `if:` to get subtly wrong.
[`../scripts/ci/check-workflow.sh`](../scripts/ci/check-workflow.sh) asserts the
absence, because an absence is what a later edit restores unnoticed, and it
asserts the step order for the same reason: every wrong ordering above reads as
plausible in a diff.

⭐ **The restore is verified by the same guard, inverted.** A host that can reach
the network again is one `--egress` **refuses**, so a guard that still passes
after the restore means the route never came back and the upload would have
failed with a network error naming nothing.

⛔ **`capture-run` builds nothing.** A capture that discovered a missing
dependency under containment would have to restore egress to fix it, on the host
that exists to have none, so the observer is a path to an already built binary
and a missing one is *could not run*. That makes the step order enforced rather
than remembered.

⚠ **What it captures today is a fixture, and the attestation says so.**
`kind=fixture`, `measured_build=none` and `stock_client=false` are fields rather
than prose, because a bundle that outlived its context would otherwise read as a
measurement of a client. Nothing is installed there.

## The workflow that installs a product

[`../.github/workflows/capture-client.yml`](../.github/workflows/capture-client.yml)
is the second capture workflow and the one that runs somebody else's binary.
`CLIENT-01`, `CLIENT-05` and `CLIENT-06` own the adapters it drives.

⛔ **It is a separate file rather than a branch inside the first**, because the
step order it needs is different and the order *is* the containment. A
conditional install inside `capture.yml` would be a step that sometimes runs and
sometimes does not, in the one place where every reader has to be able to see
what happened without reading an expression.

| step | why it is where it is |
| --- | --- |
| claim the host | ⛔ first, and before the install as well as before the capture: a product installed on a host nothing established was disposable is state on a machine that may be kept |
| build the observer | while the network still exists, and it is every binary the job runs rather than only the observer |
| resolve the release artifact | ⛔ before the install, which needs its answer, and therefore before the route is cut. Only on the `release` lane: a package index needs no artifact chosen |
| install the client | ⛔ also while the network still exists. `capture-client` refuses to install anything, and a package index is unreachable from a host with no default route. ⛔ The route's output goes to a **file** and is printed afterwards, so nothing the product spawns inherits the step's own output pipe: a runner ends a step when the command has gone *and* that pipe has reached end of file, and one process left holding it keeps the step open with a zero exit code in it |
| cut the route off this host | both address families, routes saved first |
| assert containment | the guard reads the kernel, not the step above |
| capture | the build is handed the torrent and reads the tracker's address out of it |
| restore the route | only to upload, after the measurement is on disk |
| upload the evidence bundle | the bundle and the install record together, `if-no-files-found: error` |
| upload the install logs | ⛔ last, and `if: always()`. It sat between the install and the route cut for four dispatches on the reasoning that a job which never reached the capture would upload nothing - and an `always()` step at the end runs after a failed step too, which run 7 measured: a lane whose install refused still uploaded its logs from here. ⚠ What the early position cost was every aria2 capture, to a hang `CI-08` owns |

⛔ **Every upload is after the restore, and that is a rule rather than a
habit.** Between *Cut the route* and *Restore the route* the host has no way off
itself, so an upload placed there cannot reach GitHub at all.
[`../scripts/ci/check-workflow.sh`](../scripts/ci/check-workflow.sh) asserts it
for both uploads, because the install logs have already moved once.

⛔ **The evidence upload is fatal and the install-logs upload is not, and the
asymmetry is enforced.** A capture that measured a build and uploaded nothing
must be red, so that step declares `if-no-files-found: error` and carries no
`continue-on-error`; a `continue-on-error: true` two keys away would silently
undo it and leave a green run with no evidence anywhere. The install-logs upload
is a diagnostic aid and is non-fatal on purpose.

⚠ **Those two install constraints are new and nothing else enforces them**, so
[`../scripts/ci/check-workflow.sh`](../scripts/ci/check-workflow.sh) asserts both
as ordering cases. ⛔ Its capture block reads **every** `capture*.yml` in the
workflow directory rather than the one file it was written for: a rule over one
workflow is not a rule over the sibling that installs a stranger's binary, which
is the one-gated-door shape applied to a rule instead of to a code path.

⭐ **One job per adapter AND per route, and `fail-fast: false`.** Each is a
separate host acquiring one product through one route, so a matrix that stopped
at the first red would throw away measurements already taken on machines that are
about to be destroyed.

⛔ **One route per host is the design rather than the shape the matrix happened
to take.** `ACQ-03` compares what two routes installed, and two routes on one
machine means the second installs over the first: the digest comparison then has
one host's final state to look at rather than two independent acquisitions.
⚠ The default dispatch runs `["package"]` alone, which is what every dispatch so
far ran; adding `"release"` runs a second host per adapter.

⛔ **An artifact name carries the route, and it has to.** Two legs now share an
adapter and differ only in the route, so a name built from the adapter alone
would be two uploads under one name in one run - which the upload action refuses,
turning a green capture into a failed upload for a reason nothing in the step
says.

⭐ **The driver and the verifier are both somebody else's code.** `curl` is a
complete HTTP client and puts real bytes through the observer; `sha256sum -c`
and `Get-FileHash` test the digests the observer declared, rather than the
observer checking itself. ⛔ And the announce carries `key=<run-id>`, a token the
driver knows it sent, which the transcript must hold: everything else is
satisfied by a bundle of empty artifacts that verify against their own empty
digests.

## What this does not establish

⚠ **The guards prove they fire. They do not prove they are sufficient.** A host
can be non-disposable in ways neither models: a mounted network share, a
hypervisor snapshot restored between runs, a container sharing a writable layer
with its siblings. Those are not detected here, and
[`security/remote-ops.md`](security/remote-ops.md) carries what the operator
owns.
